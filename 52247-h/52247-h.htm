<h2>A Man from the North</h2>

<hr class="tb" />


<h4>CHAPTER I</h4>


<p>There grows in the North Country a certain
kind of youth of whom it may be said
that he is born to be a Londoner. The
metropolis, and everything that appertains to it,
that comes down from it, that goes up into it, has
for him an imperious fascination. Long before
schooldays are over he learns to take a doleful
pleasure in watching the exit of the London train
from the railway station. He stands by the hot engine
and envies the very stoker. Gazing curiously
into the carriages, he wonders that men and women
who in a few hours will be treading streets called
Piccadilly and the Strand can contemplate the immediate
future with so much apparent calmness;
some of them even have the audacity to look bored.
He finds it difficult to keep from throwing himself
in the guard's van as it glides past him; and not until
the last coach is a speck upon the distance does he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
turn away and, nodding absently to the ticket-clerk,
who knows him well, go home to nurse a vague ambition
and dream of Town.</p>

<p>London is the place where newspapers are issued,
books written, and plays performed. And this
youth, who now sits in an office, reads all the newspapers.
He knows exactly when a new work by a
famous author should appear, and awaits the reviews
with impatience. He can tell you off-hand the
names of the pieces in the bills of the twenty principal
West-end theatres, what their quality is, and
how long they may be expected to run; and on the
production of a new play, the articles of the dramatic
critics provide him with sensations almost as
vivid as those of the most zealous first-nighter at the
performance itself.</p>

<p>Sooner or later, perhaps by painful roads, he
reaches the goal of his desire. London accepts him&mdash;on
probation; and as his strength is, so she demeans
herself. Let him be bold and resolute, and
she will make an obeisance, but her heel is all too
ready to crush the coward and hesitant; and her
victims, once underfoot, do not often rise again.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER II</h4>


<p>The antique four-wheeler, top-heavy with
luggage, swung unsteadily round by Tattersall's
and into Raphael Street. Richard
thrust down the window with a sharp bang, indicative
of a strange new sense of power; but before the
cab came to a standstill he had collected himself,
and managed to alight with considerable decorum.
When the door opened in answer to his second ring,
a faint, sour odour escaped from the house, and he
remembered the friendly feminine warnings which
he had received at Bursley on the subject of London
lodgings. The aspect of the landlady, however,
reassured him; she was a diminutive old woman in
ridiculously short skirts, with a yellow, crinkled face,
grey eyes, and a warm, benevolent smile that conquered.
As she greeted Richard she blushed like
a girl, and made a little old-fashioned curtsey.
Richard offered his hand, and, after wiping hers on
a clean apron, she took it timidly.</p>

<p>"I hope we shall get on well together, sir," she
said, looking straight up into her new lodger's eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm sure we shall," answered Richard, sincerely.</p>

<p>She preceded him up the narrow, frowsy staircase,
which was full of surprising turns.</p>

<p>"You'll find these stairs a bit awkward at first,"
she apologised. "I've often thought of getting a
bit of nice carpet on them, but what's the use? It
would be done for in a week. Now, here's your
room, sir, first floor front, with two nice French windows,
you see, and a nice balcony. Now, about
tidying it of a morning, sir. If you'll step out for
a walk as soon as you get up, my daughter shall
make the bed, and dust, and you'll come in and find
it all nice and straight for breakfast."</p>

<p>"Very well," assented Richard.</p>

<p>"That's how I generally arrange with my young
men. I like them to have their breakfast in a nice
tidy room, you see, sir. Now, what will you have
for tea, sir? A little nice bread and butter...."</p>

<p>When she was gone Richard formally surveyed
his quarters: a long, rather low room, its length cut
by the two windows which were Mrs. Rowbotham's
particular pride; between the windows a table with a
faded green cloth, and a small bed opposite; behind
the door an artfully concealed washstand; the mantelpiece,
painted mustard yellow, bore divers squat
earthenware figures, and was surmounted by an oblong
mirror framed in rosewood; over the mirror an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
illuminated text, "Trust in Jesus," and over the text
an oleograph, in collision with the ceiling, entitled,
"After the Battle of Culloden." The walls were
decorated with a pattern of giant pink roses; and
here and there, hiding the roses, were hung photographs
of persons in their Sunday clothes, and landscapes
hand-painted in oil, depicting bridges, trees,
water, and white sails in the distance. But the furnishing
of the room caused Richard no uneasiness;
in a few moments he had mentally arranged how to
make the place habitable, and thenceforth he only
saw what should and would be.</p>

<p>Tea was brought in by a girl whose face proclaimed
her to be Mrs. Rowbotham's daughter. At
the sight of her Richard privately winked; he had
read in books about landladies' daughters, but this
one gave the lie to books; she was young, she was
beautiful, and Richard would have sworn to her innocence.
With an accession of boldness which surprised
himself, he inquired her name.</p>

<p>"Lily, sir," she said, blushing like her mother.</p>

<p>He cut the new, heavy bread, and poured out a
cup of tea with the awkwardness of one unaccustomed
to such work, and, having made space on the
tray, set the evening paper against the sugar basin,
and began to eat and read. Outside were two piano
organs, children shouting, and a man uttering some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
monotonous unintelligible cry. It grew dark; Mrs.
Rowbotham came in with a lamp and cleared the
table; Richard was looking through the window, and
neither spoke. Presently he sat down. That being
his first night in London, he had determined to
spend it quietly <i>at home</i>. The piano organs and the
children were still strident. A peculiar feeling of
isolation momentarily overcame him, and the noises
of the street seemed to recede. Then he went to
the window again, and noticed that the children were
dancing quite gracefully; it occurred to him that they
might be ballet children. He picked up the paper
and examined the theatrical advertisements, at first
idly, but afterwards in detail.</p>

<p>With a long sigh, he took his hat and stick, and
went very slowly downstairs. Mrs. Rowbotham
heard him fumbling with the catch of the front door.</p>

<p>"Are you going out, sir?"</p>

<p>"Only just for a walk," said Richard, nonchalantly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'd better give you a latch-key?"</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>Another moment and he was in the delicious
streets, going east.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>




<h4>CHAPTER III</h4>


<p>Although he had visited London but
once before, and then only for a few hours,
he was not unfamiliar with the topography
of the town, having frequently studied it in
maps and an old copy of Kelly's directory.</p>

<p>He walked slowly up Park Side and through
Piccadilly, picking out as he passed them the French
Embassy, Hyde Park Corner, Apsley House, Park
Lane, and Devonshire House. As he drank in the
mingled glare and glamour of Piccadilly by night,&mdash;the
remote stars, the high sombre trees, the vast,
dazzling interiors of clubs, the sinuous, flickering
lines of traffic, the radiant faces of women framed
in hansoms,&mdash;he laughed the laugh of luxurious
contemplation, acutely happy. At last, at last, he
had come into his inheritance. London accepted
him. He was hers; she his; and nothing should part
them. Starvation in London would itself be bliss.
But he had no intention of starving! Filled with
great purposes, he straightened his back, and just
then a morsel of mud thrown up from a bus-wheel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
splashed warm and gritty on his cheek. He wiped it
off caressingly, with a smile.</p>

<p>Although it was Saturday night, and most of the
shops were closed, an establishment where watches
and trinkets of "Anglo-Spanish" gold, superb in
appearance and pillowed on green plush, were retailed
at alluring prices, still threw a brilliant light
on the pavement, and Richard crossed the road to
inspect its wares. He turned away, but retraced his
steps and entered the shop. An assistant politely inquired
his wishes.</p>

<p>"I want one of those hunters you have in the
window at 29/6," said Richard, with a gruffness
which must have been involuntary.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Here is one. We guarantee that the
works are equal to the finest English lever."</p>

<p>"I'll take it." He put down the money.</p>

<p>"Thank you. Can I show you anything else?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, thanks," still more gruffly.</p>

<p>"We have some excellent chains...."</p>

<p>"Nothing else, thanks." And he walked out,
putting his purchase in his pocket. A perfectly reliable
gold watch, which he had worn for years,
already lay there.</p>

<p>At Piccadilly Circus he loitered, and then crossed
over and went along Coventry Street to Leicester
Square. The immense façade of the Ottoman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Theatre of Varieties, with its rows of illuminated
windows and crescent moons set against the sky, rose
before him, and the glory of it was intoxicating. It
is not too much to say that the Ottoman held a
stronger fascination for Richard than any other
place in London. The British Museum, Fleet
Street, and the Lyceum were magic names, but more
magical than either was the name of the Ottoman.
The Ottoman, on the rare occasions when it happened
to be mentioned in Bursley, was a synonym
for all the glittering vices of the metropolis. It
stank in the nostrils of the London delegates who
came down to speak at the annual meetings of the
local Society for the Suppression of Vice. But how
often had Richard, somnolent in chapel, mitigated
the rigours of a long sermon by dreaming of an
Ottoman ballet,&mdash;one of those voluptuous spectacles,
all legs and white arms, which from time to
time were described so ornately in the London daily
papers.</p>

<p>The brass-barred swinging doors of the Grand
Circle entrance were simultaneously opened for him
by two human automata dressed exactly alike in long
semi-military coats, a very tall man and a stunted
boy. He advanced with what air of custom he
could command, and after taking a ticket and
traversing a heavily decorated corridor encountered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
another pair of swinging doors; they
opened, and a girl passed out, followed by a man
who was talking to her vehemently in French. At
the same moment a gust of distant music struck
Richard's ear. As he climbed a broad, thick-piled
flight of steps, the music became louder, and a clapping
of hands could be heard. At the top of the
steps hung a curtain of blue velvet; he pushed aside
its stiff, heavy folds with difficulty, and entered the
auditorium.</p>

<p>The smoke of a thousand cigarettes enveloped
the furthest parts of the great interior in a thin bluish
haze, which was dissipated as it reached the
domed ceiling in the rays of a crystal chandelier.
Far in front and a little below the level of the circle
lay a line of footlights broken by the silhouette of
the conductor's head. A diminutive, solitary figure
in red and yellow stood in the centre of the huge
stage; it was kissing its hands to the audience with
a mincing, operatic gesture; presently it tripped off
backwards, stopping at every third step to bow; the
applause ceased, and the curtain fell slowly.</p>

<p>The broad, semicircular promenade which
flanked the seats of the grand circle was filled with
a well-dressed, well-fed crowd. The men talked
and laughed, for the most part, in little knots, while
in and out, steering their way easily and rapidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
among these groups, moved the women: some with
rouged cheeks, greasy vermilion lips, and enormous
liquid eyes; others whose faces were innocent of
cosmetics and showed pale under the electric light;
but all with a peculiar, exaggerated swing of the
body from the hips, and all surreptitiously regarding
themselves in the mirrors which abounded on every
glowing wall.</p>

<p>Richard stood aloof against a pillar. Near him
were two men in evening dress conversing in tones
which just rose above the general murmur of talk
and the high, penetrating tinkle of glass from the
bar behind the promenade.</p>

<p>"And what did she say then?" one of the pair
asked smilingly. Richard strained his ear to listen.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>she</i> told <i>me</i>," the other said, speaking
with a dreamy drawl, while fingering his watch-chain
absently and gazing down at the large diamond
in his shirt,&mdash;"<i>she</i> told <i>me</i> that she said she'd do
for him if he didn't fork out. But I don't believe
her. You know, of course.... There's Lottie...."</p>

<p>The band suddenly began to play, and after a
few crashing bars the curtain went up for the ballet.
The rich <i>coup d'oeil</i> which presented itself provoked
a burst of clapping from the floor of the house and
the upper tiers, but to Richard's surprise no one in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
his proximity seemed to exhibit any interest in the
entertainment. The two men still talked with their
backs to the stage, the women continued to find a
pathway between the groups, and from within the
bar came the unabated murmur of voices and tinkle
of glass.</p>

<p>Richard never took his dazed eyes from the
stage. The moving pageant unrolled itself before
him like a vision, rousing new sensations, tremors of
strange desires. He was under a spell, and when at
last the curtain descended to the monotonous roll of
drums, he awoke to the fact that several people were
watching him curiously. Blushing slightly, he went
to a far corner of the promenade. At one of the
little tables a woman sat alone. She held her head
at an angle, and her laughing, lustrous eyes gleamed
invitingly at Richard. Without quite intending to
do so he hesitated in front of her, and she twittered
a phrase ending in <i>chéri</i>.</p>

<p>He abruptly turned away. He would have been
very glad to remain and say something clever, but
his tongue refused its office, and his legs moved of
themselves.</p>

<p>At midnight he found himself in Piccadilly Circus,
unwilling to go home. He strolled leisurely back to
Leicester Square. The front of the Ottoman was
in darkness, and the square almost deserted.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>




<h4>CHAPTER IV</h4>


<p>He walked home to Raphael Street. The
house was dead, except for a pale light in
his own room. At the top of the bare,
creaking stairs he fumbled a moment for the handle
of his door, and the regular sound of two distinct
snores descended from an upper storey. He closed
the door softly, locked it, and glanced round the
room with some eagerness. The smell of the expiring
lamp compelled him to unlatch both windows.
He extinguished the lamp, and after lighting a couple
of candles on the mantelpiece drew a chair to the
fireplace and sat down to munch an apple. The
thought occurred to him: "This is my home&mdash;for
how long?"</p>

<p>And then:</p>

<p>"Why the dickens didn't I say something to that
girl?"</p>

<p>Between the candles on the mantelpiece was a photograph
of his sister, which he had placed there before
going out. He looked at it with a half smile,
and murmured audibly several times:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why the dickens didn't I say something to that
girl, with her <i>chéri</i>?"</p>

<p>The woman of the photograph seemed to be between
thirty and forty years of age. She was fair,
with a mild, serious face, and much wavy hair. The
forehead was broad and smooth and white, the
cheek-bones prominent, and the mouth somewhat
large. The eyes were a very light grey; they met
the gaze of the spectator with a curious timid defiance,
as if to say, "I am weak, but I can at least fight
till I fall." Underneath the eyes&mdash;the portrait
was the work of an amateur, and consequently had
not been robbed of all texture by retouching&mdash;a
few crowsfeet could be seen.</p>

<p>As far back as Richard's memory went, he and
Mary had lived together and alone in the small Red
House which lay half a mile out of Bursley, towards
Turnhill, on the Manchester road. At one time it
had been rurally situated, creeping plants had
clothed its red walls, and the bare patch behind it
had been a garden; but the gradual development of
a coal-producing district had covered the fields with
smooth, mountainous heaps of grey refuse, and
stunted or killed every tree in the neighbourhood.
The house was undermined, and in spite of iron
clamps had lost most of its rectangles, while the rent
had dropped to fifteen pounds a year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Mary was very much older than her brother, and
she had always appeared to him exactly the mature
woman of the photograph. Of his parents he
knew nothing except what Mary had told him, which
was little and vague, for she watchfully kept the
subject at a distance.</p>

<p>She had supported herself and Richard in comfort
by a medley of vocations, teaching the piano,
collecting rents, and practising the art of millinery.
They had few friends. The social circles of Bursley
were centred in its churches and chapels; and
though Mary attended the Wesleyan sanctuary with
some regularity, she took small interest in prayer-meetings,
class-meetings, bazaars, and all the other
minor religious activities, thus neglecting opportunities
for intercourse which might have proved
agreeable. She had sent Richard to the Sunday-school;
but when, at the age of fourteen, he protested
that Sunday-school was "awful rot," she answered
calmly, "Don't go, then;" and from that
day his place in class was empty. Soon afterwards
the boy cautiously insinuated that chapel belonged to
the same category as Sunday-school, but the hint
failed of its effect.</p>

<p>The ladies of the town called sometimes, generally
upon business, and took afternoon tea. Once
the vicar's wife, who wished to obtain musical tuition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
for her three youngest daughters at a nominal
fee, came in and found Richard at a book on the
hearthrug.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said she. "Just like his father, is he not,
Miss Larch?" Mary made no reply.</p>

<p>The house was full of books. Richard knew them
all well by sight, but until he was sixteen he read only
a select handful of volumes which had stood the test
of years. Often he idly speculated as to the contents
of some of the others,&mdash;"Horatii Opera," for
instance: had that anything to do with theatres?&mdash;yet
for some curious reason, which when he grew
older he sought for in vain, he never troubled himself
to look into them. Mary read a good deal,
chiefly books and magazines fetched for her by
Richard from the Free Library.</p>

<p>When he was about seventeen, a change came.
He was aware dimly, and as if by instinct, that his
sister's life in the early days had not been without its
romance. Certainly there was something hidden between
her and William Vernon, the science master
at the Institute, for they were invariably at great
pains to avoid each other. He sometimes wondered
whether Mr. Vernon was connected in any way with
the melancholy which was never, even in her
brightest moments, wholly absent from Mary's demeanour.
One Sunday night&mdash;Richard had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
keeping house&mdash;Mary, coming in late from chapel,
threw his arms round his neck as he opened the
door, and, dragging down his face to hers, kissed
him hysterically again and again.</p>

<p>"Dicky, Dick," she whispered, laughing and crying
at the same time, "something's happened. I'm
almost an old woman, but something's happened!"</p>

<p>"I know," said Richard, retreating hurriedly from
her embrace. "You're going to marry Mr. Vernon."</p>

<p>"But how could you tell?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I just guessed."</p>

<p>"You don't mind, Dick, do you?"</p>

<p>"I! Mind!" Afraid lest his feelings should
appear too plainly, he asked abruptly for supper.</p>

<p>Mary gave up her various callings, the wedding
took place, and William Vernon came to live with
them. It was then that Richard began to read more
widely, and to form a definite project of going to
London.</p>

<p>He could not fail to respect and like William.
The life of the married pair seemed to him idyllic;
the tender, furtive manifestations of affection which
were constantly passing between Mary and her
sedate, middle-aged husband touched him deeply,
and at the thought of the fifteen irretrievable years
during which some ridiculous misunderstanding had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
separated this loving couple, his eyes were not quite
as dry as a youth could wish. But with it all he
was uncomfortable. He felt himself an intruder
upon holy privacies; if at meal-times husband and
wife clasped hands round the corner of the table, he
looked at his plate; if they smiled happily upon no
discoverable provocation, he pretended not to notice
the fact. They did not need him. Their
hearts were full of kindness for every living thing,
but unconsciously they stood aloof. He was driven
in upon himself, and spent much of his time either in
solitary walking or hidden in an apartment called the
study.</p>

<p>He ordered magazines whose very names Mr.
Holt, the principal bookseller in Bursley, was unfamiliar
with, and after the magazines came books
of verse and novels enclosed in covers of mystic
design, and printed in a style which Mr. Holt,
though secretly impressed, set down as eccentric.
Mr. Holt's shop performed the functions of a club
for the dignitaries of the town; and since he took
care that this esoteric literature was well displayed
on the counter until called for, the young man's fame
as <i>a great reader</i> soon spread, and Richard began
to see that he was regarded as a curiosity of which
Bursley need not be ashamed. His self-esteem, already
fostered into lustiness by a number of facile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
school successes, became more marked, although he
was wise enough to keep a great deal of it to himself.</p>

<p>One evening, after Mary and her husband had
been talking quietly some while, Richard came into
the sitting-room.</p>

<p>"I don't want any supper," he said, "I'm going
for a bit of a walk."</p>

<p>"Shall we tell him?" Mary asked, smiling, after
he had left the room.</p>

<p>"Please yourself," said William, also smiling.</p>

<p>"He talks a great deal about going to London.
I hope he won't go till&mdash;after April; I think it
would upset me."</p>

<p>"You need not trouble, I think, my dear,"
William answered. "He talks about it, but he
isn't gone yet."</p>

<p>Mr. Vernon was not quite pleased with Richard.
He had obtained for him&mdash;being connected with
the best people in the town&mdash;a position as shorthand
and general clerk in a solicitor's office, and had
learnt privately that though the youth was smart
enough, he was scarcely making that progress which
might have been expected. He lacked "application."
William attributed this shortcoming to the
excessive reading of verse and obscure novels.</p>

<p>April came, and, as Mr. Vernon had foretold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Richard still remained in Bursley. But the older
man was now too deeply absorbed in another matter
to interest himself at all in Richard's movements,&mdash;a
matter in which Richard himself exhibited a shy
concern. Hour followed anxious hour, and at last
was heard the faint, fretful cry of a child in the
night. Then stillness. All that Richard ever saw
was a coffin, and in it a dead child at a dead woman's
feet.</p>

<p>Fifteen months later he was in London.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER V</h4>


<p>Mr. Curpet, of the firm of Curpet and
Smythe, whose name was painted in
black and white on the dark green
door, had told him that the office hours were from
nine-thirty to six. The clock of the Law Courts
was striking a quarter to ten. He hesitated a moment,
and then seized the handle; but the door was
fast, and he descended the two double flights of iron
stairs into the quadrangle.</p>

<p>New Serjeant's Court was a large modern building
of very red brick with terra-cotta facings, eight
storeys high; but in spite of its faults of colour and
its excessive height, ample wall spaces and temperate
ornamentation gave it a dignity and comeliness sufficient
to distinguish it from other buildings in the
locality. In the centre of the court was an oval
patch of brown earth, with a few trees whose pale-leaved
tops, struggling towards sunlight, reached to
the middle of the third storey. Round this plantation
ran an immaculate roadway of wooden blocks,
flanked by an equally immaculate asphalt footpath.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
The court possessed its own private lamp-posts, and
these were wrought of iron in an antique design.</p>

<p>Men and boys, grave and unconsciously oppressed
by the burden of the coming day, were continually
appearing out of the gloom of the long tunnelled
entrance and vanishing into one or other of the
twelve doorways. Presently a carriage and pair
drove in, and stopped opposite Richard. A big man
of about fifty, with a sagacious red and blue face,
jumped alertly out, followed by an attentive clerk
carrying a blue sack. It seemed to Richard that he
knew the features of the big man from portraits,
and, following the pair up the staircase of No. 2, he
discovered from the legend on the door through
which they disappeared that he had been in the
presence of Her Majesty's Attorney-General. Simultaneously
with a misgiving as to his ability to
reach the standard of clerical ability doubtless required
by Messrs. Curpet and Smythe, who did
business cheek by jowl with an attorney-general and
probably employed him, came an elevation of spirit
as he darkly guessed what none can realise completely,
that a man's future lies on his own knees,
and on the knees of no gods whatsoever.</p>

<p>He continued his way upstairs, but Messrs. Curpet
and Smythe's portal was still locked. Looking
down the well, he espied a boy crawling reluctantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
and laboriously upward, with a key in his hand which
he dragged across the bannisters. In course of time
the boy reached Messrs. Curpet and Smythe's door,
and opening it stepped neatly over a pile of letters
which lay immediately within. Richard followed
him.</p>

<p>"Oh! My name's Larch," said Richard, as if
it had just occurred to him that the boy might be interested
in the fact. "Do you know which is my
room?"</p>

<p>The boy conducted him along a dark passage with
green doors on either side, to a room at the end. It
was furnished mainly with two writing-tables and
two armchairs; in one corner was a disused copying-press,
in another an immense pile of reporters' note-books;
on the mantelpiece, a tumbler, a duster, and
a broken desk lamp.</p>

<p>"That's your seat," said the boy, pointing to the
larger table, and disappeared. Richard disposed of
his coat and hat and sat down, trying to feel at ease
and not succeeding.</p>

<p>At five minutes past ten a youth entered with the
"Times" under his arm. Richard waited for him
to speak, but he merely stared and took off his overcoat.
Then he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You've got my hook. If you don't mind I'll
put your things on this other one."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly," assented Richard.</p>

<p>The youth spread his back luxuriously to the
empty fireplace and opened the "Times," when
another and smaller boy put his head in at the
door.</p>

<p>"Jenkins, Mr. Alder wants the 'Times.'"</p>

<p>The youth silently handed over the advertisement
pages which were lying on the table. In a minute
the boy returned.</p>

<p>"Mr. Alder says he wants the inside of the
'Times.'"</p>

<p>"Tell Mr. Alder to go to hell, with my compliments."
The boy hesitated.</p>

<p>"Go on, now," Jenkins insisted. The boy hung
on the door-handle, smiling dubiously, and then went
out.</p>

<p>"Here, wait a minute!" Jenkins called him
back. "Perhaps you'd better give it him. Take
the damn thing away."</p>

<p>A sound of hurried footsteps in the next room was
succeeded by an imperious call for Jenkins, at which
Jenkins slipped nimbly into his chair and untied a
bundle of papers.</p>

<p>"Jenkins!" the call came again, with a touch of
irritation in it, but Jenkins did not move. The door
was thrust open.</p>

<p>"Oh! You are there, Jenkins. Just come in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
and take a letter down." The tones were quite
placid.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Smythe."</p>

<p>"I never take any notice of Smythe's calls," said
Jenkins, when he returned. "If he wants me, he
must either ring or fetch me. If I once began it,
I should be running in and out of his room all day,
and I've quite enough to do without that."</p>

<p>"Fidgety, eh?" Richard suggested.</p>

<p>"Fidgety's no word for it, <i>I</i> tell you. Alder&mdash;that's
the manager, you know&mdash;said only yesterday
that he has less trouble with forty Chancery actions
of Curpet's than with one county-court case of
Smythe's. I know I'd a jolly sight sooner write
forty of Curpet's letters than ten of Smythe's. I
wish I'd got your place, and you'd got mine. I
suppose you can write shorthand rather fast."</p>

<p>"Middling," said Richard. "About 120."</p>

<p>"Oh! We had a man once who could do 150, but
he'd been a newspaper reporter. I do a bit over
a hundred, if I've not had much to drink overnight.
Let's see, they're giving you twenty-five bob, aren't
they?"</p>

<p>Richard nodded.</p>

<p>"The man before you had thirty-five, and he
couldn't spell worth a brass button. I only get
fifteen, although I've been here seven years. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
damn shame I call it! But Curpet's beastly near.
If he'd give some other people less, and me a bit
more...."</p>

<p>"Who are 'some other people'?" asked Richard,
smiling.</p>

<p>"Well, there's old Aked. He sits in the outer
office&mdash;you won't have seen him because he doesn't
generally come till eleven. They give him a pound
a week, just for doing a bit of engrossing when he
feels inclined to engross, and for being idle when he
feels inclined to be idle. He's a broken-down
something or other,&mdash;used to be clerk to Curpet's
father. He has some dibs of his own, and this just
finds him amusement. I bet he doesn't do fifty
folios a week. And he's got the devil's own temper."</p>

<p>Jenkins was proceeding to describe other members
of the staff when the entry of Mr. Curpet himself
put an end to the recital. Mr. Curpet was a small
man, with a round face and a neatly trimmed beard.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Larch. If you'll kindly come
into my room, I'll dictate my letters. Good morning,
Jenkins." He smiled and withdrew, leaving
Richard excessively surprised at his suave courtesy.</p>

<p>In his own room Mr. Curpet sat before a pile of
letters, and motioned Richard to a side table.</p>

<p>"You will tell me if I go too fast," he said, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
began to dictate regularly, with scarcely a pause.
The pile of letters gradually disappeared into a basket.
Before half a dozen letters were done Richard
comprehended that he had become part of a business
machine of far greater magnitude than anything
to which he had been accustomed in Bursley.
This little man with the round face dealt impassively
with tens of thousands of pounds; he mortgaged
whole streets, bullied railway companies, and wrote
familiarly to lords. In the middle of one long letter,
a man came panting in, whom Richard at once
took for Mr. Alder, the Chancery manager. His
rather battered silk hat was at the back of his head,
and he looked distressed.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to say we've lost that summons in
Rice <i>v.</i> The L. R. Railway."</p>

<p>"Really!" said Mr. Curpet. "Better appeal,
and brief a leader, eh?"</p>

<p>"Can't appeal, Mr. Curpet."</p>

<p>"Well, we must make the best of it. Telegraph
to the country. I'll write and keep them calm.
It's a pity they were so sure. Rice will have to
economise for a year or two. What was my last
word, Larch?" The dictation proceeded.</p>

<p>One hour was allowed for lunch, and Richard
spent the first moiety of it in viewing the ambrosial
exteriors of Strand restaurants. With the exception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
of the coffee-house at Bursley, he had never been in
a restaurant in his life, and he was timid of entering
any of those sumptuous establishments whose swinging
doors gave glimpses of richly decorated ceilings,
gleaming tablecloths, and men in silk hats greedily
consuming dishes placed before them by obsequious
waiters.</p>

<p>At last, without quite knowing how he got there,
he sat in a long, low apartment, papered like an attic
bedroom, and odorous of tea and cake. The
place was crowded with young men and women
indifferently well-dressed, who bent over uncomfortably
small oblong marble-topped tables. An
increasing clatter of crockery filled the air. Waitresses,
with pale, vacant faces, dressed in dingy
black with white aprons, moved about with difficulty
at varying rates of speed, but none of them seemed
to betray an interest in Richard. Behind the
counter, on which stood great polished urns emitting
clouds of steam, were several women whose superior
rank in the restaurant was denoted by a black apron,
and after five minutes had elapsed Richard observed
one of these damsels pointing out himself to a waitress,
who approached and listened condescendingly
to his order.</p>

<p>A thin man, rather more than middle-aged, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
a grey beard and slightly red nose, entered and sat
down opposite to Richard. Without preface he began,
speaking rather fast and with an expressive vivacity
rarely met with in the ageing,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, my young friend, how do you like your
new place?"</p>

<p>Richard stared at him.</p>

<p>"Are you Mr. Aked?"</p>

<p>"The same. I suppose Master Jenkins has made
you acquainted with all my peculiarities of temper
and temperament.&mdash;Glass of milk, roll, and two
pats of butter&mdash;and, I say, my girl, try not to keep
me waiting as long as you did yesterday." There
was a bright smile on his face, which the waitress unwillingly
returned.</p>

<p>"Don't you know," he went on, looking at Richard's
plate,&mdash;"don't you know that tea and ham together
are frightfully indigestible?"</p>

<p>"I never have indigestion."</p>

<p>"No matter. You soon will have if you eat tea
and ham together. A young man should guard his
digestion like his honour. Sounds funny, doesn't
it? But it's right. An impaired digestive apparatus
has ruined many a career. It ruined mine.
You see before you, sir, what might have been an
author of repute, but for a wayward stomach."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>"You write?" Richard asked, interested at once,
but afraid lest Mr. Aked might be cumbrously joking.</p>

<p>"I used to." The old man spoke with proud self-consciousness.</p>

<p>"Have you written a book?"</p>

<p>"Not a book. But I've contributed to all manner
of magazines and newspapers."</p>

<p>"What magazines?"</p>

<p>"Well, let me see&mdash;it's so long ago. I've written
for 'Cornhill.' I wrote for 'Cornhill' when
Thackeray edited it. I spoke to Carlyle once."</p>

<p>"You did?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Carlyle said to me&mdash;Carlyle said to me&mdash;Carlyle
said&mdash;" Mr. Aked's voice dwindled to
an inarticulate murmur, and, suddenly ignoring
Richard's presence, he pulled a book from his pocket
and began to finger the leaves. It was a French
novel, "La Vie de Bohème." His face had lost all
its mobile expressiveness.</p>

<p>A little alarmed by such eccentricity, and not
quite sure that this associate of Carlyle was perfectly
sane, Richard sat silent, waiting for events.
Mr. Aked was clearly accustomed to reading while
he ate; he could even drink with his eyes on the
book. At length he pushed his plates away from
him, and closed the novel with a snap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"I see you're from the country, Larch," he said,
as if there had been no lapse in the conversation.
"Now, why in God's name did you leave the country?
Aren't there enough people in London?"</p>

<p>"Because <i>I</i> wanted to be an author," answered
Richard, with more assurance than veracity, though
he spoke in good faith. The fact was that his aspirations,
hitherto so vague as to elude analysis,
seemed within the last few minutes mysteriously to
have assumed definite form.</p>

<p>"You're a young fool, then."</p>

<p>"But I've an excellent digestion."</p>

<p>"You won't have it if you begin to write. Take
my word, you're a young fool. You don't know
what you're going in for, my little friend."</p>

<p>"Was Murger a fool?" Richard said clumsily,
determined to exhibit an acquaintance with "La Vie
de Bohème."</p>

<p>"Ha! We read French, do we?"</p>

<p>Richard blushed. The old man got up.</p>

<p>"Come along," he said peevishly. "Let's get
out of this hole."</p>

<p>At the pay-desk, waiting for change, he spoke to
the cashier, a thin girl with reddish-brown hair, who
coughed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Did you try those lozenges?"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, thanks. They <i>taste</i> nice."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Beautiful day."</p>

<p>"Yes; my word, isn't it!"</p>

<p>They walked back to the office in absolute silence;
but just as they were going in, Mr. Aked stopped,
and took Richard by the coat.</p>

<p>"Have you anything special to do next Thursday
night?"</p>

<p>"No," said Richard.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll take you to a little French restaurant
in Soho, and we'll have dinner. Half a crown.
Can you afford?"</p>

<p>Richard nodded.</p>

<p>"And, I say, bring along some of your manuscripts,
and I'll flay them alive for you."</p>

<h4>CHAPTER VI</h4>


<p>An inconstant, unrefreshing breeze, sluggish
with accumulated impurity, stirred the curtains,
and every urban sound&mdash;high-pitched
voices of children playing, roll of wheels and
rhythmic trot of horses, shouts of newsboys and
querulous barking of dogs&mdash;came through the open
windows touched with a certain languorous quality
that suggested a city fatigued, a city yearning for
the moist recesses of woods, the disinfectant breath
of mountain tops, and the cleansing sea.</p>

<p>On the little table between the windows lay pen,
ink, and paper. Richard sat down to be an author.
Since his conversation with Mr. Aked of the day before
he had lived in the full glow of an impulse to
write. He discerned, or thought he discerned, in
the fact that he possessed the literary gift, a key to
his recent life. It explained, to be particular, the
passion for reading which had overtaken him at
seventeen, and his desire to come to London, the
natural home of the author. Certainly it was
strange that hitherto he had devoted very little serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
thought to the subject of writing, but happily
there were in existence sundry stray verses and prose
fragments written at Bursley, and it contented him
to recognise in these the first tremulous stirrings of
a late-born ambition.</p>

<p>During the previous evening he had busied himself
in deciding upon a topic. In a morning paper
he had read an article entitled "An Island of
Sleep," descriptive of Sark; it occurred to him that
a similar essay upon Lichfield, the comatose cathedral
city which lay about thirty miles from Bursley, might
suit a monthly magazine. He knew Lichfield well;
he had been accustomed to visit it from childhood;
he loved it. As a theme full of picturesque opportunities
it had quickened his imagination, until his
brain seemed to surge with vague but beautiful fancies.
In the night his sleep had been broken, and
several new ideas had suggested themselves. And
now, after a day of excited anticipation, the moment
for composition had arrived.</p>

<p>As he dipped his pen in the ink a sudden apprehension
of failure surprised him. He dismissed it,
and wrote in a bold hand, rather carefully,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>MEMORIES OF A CITY OF SLEEP.</p></blockquote>

<p>That was surely an excellent title. He proceeded:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>On the old stone bridge, beneath which the clear,
smooth waters of the river have crept at the same
pace for centuries, stands a little child, alone. It
is early morning, and the clock of the time-stained
cathedral which lifts its noble gothic towers scarce
a hundred yards away, strikes five, to the accompaniment
of an unseen lark overhead.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>He sat back to excogitate the next sentence, staring
around the room as if he expected to find the
words written on the wall. One of the gilt-framed
photographs was slightly askew; he left his chair
to put it straight; several other pictures seemed to
need adjustment, and he levelled them all with
scrupulous precision. The ornaments on the mantelpiece
were not evenly balanced; these he rearranged
entirely. Then, having first smoothed out a crease
in the bedcover, he sat down again.</p>

<p>But most of the beautiful ideas which he had persuaded
himself were firmly within his grasp, now
eluded him, or tardily presented themselves in a
form so obscure as to be valueless, and the useful
few that remained defied all attempts to bring them
into order. Dashed by his own impotence, he sought
out the article on Sark, and examined it afresh.
Certain weekly organs of literature had educated
him to sneer at the journalism of the daily press, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
it appeared that the man who wrote "An Island of
Sleep" was at least capable of expressing himself
with clearness and fluency, and possessed the skill to
pass naturally from one aspect of his subject to another.
It seemed simple enough....</p>

<p>He went to the window.</p>

<p>The sky was a delicate amber, and Richard
watched it change to rose, and from rose to light
blue. The gas-lamps glared out in quick succession;
some one lowered the blind of a window opposite
his own, and presently a woman's profile was
silhouetted against it for a moment, and then
vanished. A melody came from the public house,
sung in a raucous baritone to the thrumming of a
guitar; the cries of the playing children had now
ceased.</p>

<p>Suddenly turning into the room, he was astonished
to find it almost in darkness; he could distinguish
only the whiteness of the papers on the table.</p>

<p>He was not in the mood for writing to-night.
Some men wrote best in the evening, others in the
morning. Probably he belonged to the latter class.
Be that as it might, he would rise at six the next
morning and make a new beginning. "It's only a
question of practice, of course," he said, half aloud,
repressing a troublesome dubiety. He would take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
a short walk, and go early to bed. Gradually his
self-confidence returned.</p>

<p>As he closed the front door there was a rustle
of silks and a transient odour of violets; a woman
had gone by. She turned slightly at the sound of
the door, and Richard had a glimpse of a young and
pretty face under a spreading hat, a full, ripe bust
whose alluring contours were perfectly disclosed by
a tight-fitting bodice, and two small white hands,
in one a dangling pair of gloves, in the other an
umbrella. He passed her, and waited at the corner
by Tattersall's till she overtook him again. Now
she stood on the kerb within six feet of him, humming
an air and smiling to herself. Up went the
umbrella to signal for a hansom.</p>

<p>"The Ottoman," Richard heard her say across
the roof of the cab, the driver leaning forward with
his hand to his ear. What a child's voice it seemed,
lisping and artless!</p>

<p>The cabman winked at Richard, and gently flicked
his horse. In a moment the hansom was two
dwindling specks of red in a shifting multitude of
lights.</p>

<p>An hour later he saw her in the promenade of the
theatre; she stood against a pillar, her eyes on the
entrance. As their glances met, she threw her head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
a little backwards, like one who looks through
spectacles on the end of his nose, and showed her
teeth. He sat down near her.</p>

<p>Presently she waved her hand to a man who was
coming in. He seemed about thirty, with small,
clear eyes, bronzed cheeks, a heavy jaw, and a closely
trimmed brown moustache. He was fashionably
garbed, though not in evening dress, and he greeted
her without raising his hat.</p>

<p>"Shall we have a drink?" she suggested. "I'm
so thirsty."</p>

<p>"Fizz?" the man drawled. She nodded.</p>

<p>Soon they went out together, the man carelessly
stuffing change for a five-pound note into his pocket.</p>

<p>"What's the difference between him and me?"
Richard reflected as he walked home. "But just
wait a bit; wait till I've...."</p>

<p>When he reached his lodging the meanness of the
room, of his clothes, of his supper, nauseated him.
He dreamed that he was kissing the Ottoman girl,
and that she lisped, "Nice boy," whereupon he cast
a handful of sovereigns on her lap.</p>

<p>At six o'clock the next morning he was working
at his article. In two days it was finished, and he
had despatched it to a monthly magazine, "together
with a stamped directed envelope for its return
if unsuitable," in accordance with the editorial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
instructions printed below the table of contents in
every number. The editor of the "Trifler"
promised that all manuscripts so submitted, and
written on one side of the paper only, should be
dealt with promptly.</p>

<p>He had been expecting to discuss his work with
Mr. Aked at the proposed dinner, but this had not
taken place. On the morning after the arrangement
had been made, Mr. Aked fell ill, and in a
few days he wrote to resign his post, saying that he
had sufficient to live on, and felt "too venerable for
regular work."</p>

<p>Richard held but the frailest hope that "A City
of Sleep" would be accepted, but when the third
morning arrived, and the postman brought nothing,
his opinion of the article began to rise. Perhaps it
had merit, after all; he recalled certain parts of it
which were distinctly clever and striking. Hurrying
home from the office that afternoon, he met the
landlady's daughter on the stairs, and said casually,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Any letters for me, Lily?"</p>

<p>"No, sir." The girl had an attractive blush.</p>

<p>"I'll take a couple of eggs for tea, if Mrs. Rowbotham
has them."</p>

<p>He remained at home in the evening, waiting for
the last delivery, which occurred about 9:30. The
double knocks of the postman were audible ten or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
twelve houses away. At last Richard heard him
mounting the steps of No. 74, and then his curt rat-tat
shook the house. A little thud on the bare
wooden floor of the hall seemed to indicate a heavier
package than the ordinary letter.</p>

<p>As, when a man is drowning, the bad actions of a
whole lifetime present themselves to him in one
awful flash, so at that moment all the faults, the
hopeless crudities, of "A City of Sleep" confronted
Richard. He wondered at his own fatuity in imagining
for a single instant that the article had the
barest chance of acceptance. Was it not notorious
that famous authors had written industriously for
years without selling a line!</p>

<p>Lily came in with the supper-tray. She was smiling.</p>

<p>"Warm work, eh, Lily?" he said, scarcely knowing
that he spoke.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, it's that hot in the kitchen you wouldn't
believe." Setting down the tray, she handed him a
foolscap envelope, and he saw his own handwriting
as if in a dream.</p>

<p>"For me?" he murmured carelessly, and placed
the letter on the mantelpiece. Lily took his orders
for breakfast, and with a pleasant, timid "Good-night,
sir," left the room.</p>

<p>He opened the envelope. In the fold of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
manuscript was a sheet of the best cream-laid note-paper
bearing these words in flowing copperplate:
"The Editor presents his compliments to Mr. Larch
[written] and regrets to be unable to use the enclosed
article, for the offer of which he is much obliged."</p>

<p>The sight of this circular, with the offices of the
magazine illustrated at the top, and the notification
in the left-hand corner that all letters must be addressed
to the editor and not to any member of the
staff individually, in some mysterious way mitigated
Richard's disappointment. Perhaps the comfort of
it lay in the tangible assurance it afforded that he
was now actually <i>a literary aspirant</i> and had communications,
however mortifying, with <i>the press</i>.</p>

<p>He read the circular again and again during supper,
and determined to re-write the article. But
this resolve was not carried out. He could not
bring himself even to glance through it, and finally it
was sent to another magazine exactly as it stood.</p>

<p>Richard had determined to say nothing in the office
about his writing until he could produce a printed
article with his name at the foot; and frequently during
the last few days his mouth had watered as he
anticipated the sweetness of that triumph. But next
day he could not refrain from showing to Jenkins
the note from the "Trifler." Jenkins seemed impressed,
especially when Richard requested him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
treat the matter as confidential. A sort of friendship
arose between them, and strengthened as time went
on. Richard sometimes wondered how precisely it
had come about, and why it continued.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER VII</h4>


<p>Albert Jenkins was nineteen years of
age, and lived with his parents and seven
brothers and sisters in Camberwell; his
father managed a refreshment bar in Oxford Street.
He had been in the employ of Messrs. Curpet and
Smythe for seven years,&mdash;first as junior office boy,
then as senior office boy, and finally as junior shorthand
clerk. He was of the average height, with
a shallow chest, and thin arms and legs. His feet
were very small&mdash;he often referred to the fact with
frank complacency&mdash;and were always encased in
well-fitting hand-made boots, brightly polished.
The rest of his attire was less remarkable for neatness;
but at intervals an ambition to be genteel possessed
him, and during these recurrent periods the
nice conduct of his fingernails interfered somewhat
with official routine. He carried his hat either at
the back of his head or tilted almost upon the bridge
of his nose. In the streets he generally walked with
sedate deliberation, his hands deep in his pockets,
his eyes lowered, and an enigmatic smile on his thin
lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>His countenance was of a pale yellow complexion
just tinged with red, and he never coloured; his neck
was a darker yellow. Upon the whole, his features
were regular, except the mouth, which was large, and
protruded like a monkey's; the eyes were grey, with
a bold regard, which not seldom was excusably mistaken
for insolence.</p>

<p>Considering his years, Jenkins was a highly accomplished
person, in certain directions. Upon all
matters connected with her Majesty's mail and inland
revenue, upon cab fares, bus-routes, and local
railways, upon "Pitman outlines," and upon chamber
practice in Chancery, he was an unquestioned authority.
He knew the addresses of several hundred
London solicitors, the locality of nearly every street
and square within the four-mile radius, and, within
the same limits, the approximate distance of any one
given spot from any other given spot.</p>

<p>He was the best billiard-player in the office, and
had once made a spot-barred break of 49; this game
was his sole pastime. He gambled regularly upon
horse-races, resorting to a number of bookmakers,
but neither winning nor losing to an appreciable extent;
no less than three jockeys occasionally permitted
him to enjoy their companionship, and he was
never without a stable-tip.</p>

<p>His particular hobby, however, was restaurants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
He spent half his income upon food, and quite half
his waking hours either in deciding what he should
consume, or in actual drinking and mastication. He
had personally tested the merits of every bar and
house of refreshment in the neighbourhood of the
Law Courts, from Lockhart's to Gatti's, and would
discourse for hours on their respective virtues and
defects. No restaurant was too mean for his
patronage, and none too splendid; for days in succession
he would dine upon a glass of water and a
captain biscuit with cheese, in order to accumulate
resources for a delicate repast in one of the gilded
establishments where the rich are wont to sustain
themselves; and he had acquired from his father a
quantity of curious lore, throwing light upon the
secrets of the refreshment trade, which enabled him
to spend the money thus painfully amassed to the
best advantage.</p>

<p>Jenkins was a cockney and the descendant of
cockneys; he conversed always volubly in the dialect
of Camberwell; but just as he was subject to attacks
of modishness, so at times he attempted to rid himself
of his accent, of course without success. He
swore habitually, and used no reticence whatever, except
in the presence of his employers and of Mr.
Alder the manager. In quick and effective retort
he was the peer of cabmen, and nothing could abash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
him. His favourite subjects of discussion were
restaurants, as before mentioned, billiards, the turf,
and women, whom he usually described as "tarts."
It was his custom to refer to himself as a "devil for
girls," and when Mr. Alder playfully accused him
of adventures with females of easy virtue, his delight
was unbounded.</p>

<p>There were moments when Richard loathed
Jenkins, when the gross and ribald atmosphere which
attended Jenkins' presence nauseated him, and utter
solitude in London seemed preferable to the
boy's company; but these passed, and the intimacy
throve. Jenkins, indeed, had his graces; he was of
an exceedingly generous nature, and his admiration
for the deep literary scholarship which he imagined
Richard to possess was ingenuous and unconcealed.
His own agile wit, his picturesque use of slang, his
facility in new oaths, and above all his exact knowledge
of the byways, and backwaters of London life,
endowed him, in Richard's unaccustomed eyes, with
a certain specious attractiveness. Moreover, the fact
that they shared the same room and performed similar
duties made familiar intercourse between them
natural and necessary. With no other member of
the staff did Richard care to associate. The articled
clerks, though courteously agreeable to everyone,
formed an exclusive coterie; and as for the rest, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
were either old or dull, or both. He often debated
whether he should seek out Mr. Aked, who was now
recovered, and had once, unfortunately in Richard's
absence, called at the office; but at length he timidly
decided that the extent of their acquaintance would
not warrant it.</p>

<p>"Where shall we go to lunch to-day?" was almost
the first question which Richard and Jenkins
asked each other in the morning, and a prolonged
discussion would follow. They called the meal
"lunch," but it was really their dinner, though
neither of them ever admitted the fact.</p>

<p>Jenkins had a predilection for grill-rooms, where
raw chops and steaks lay on huge dishes, and each
customer chose his own meat and superintended its
cooking. A steak, tender and perfectly cooked, with
baked potatoes and half a pint of stout, was his ideal
repast, and he continually lamented that no restaurant
in London offered such cheer at the price of one
shilling and threepence, including the waiter. The
cheap establishments were never satisfactory, and
Jenkins only frequented them when the state of his
purse left no alternative. In company with Richard
he visited every new eating-house that made its appearance,
in the hope of finding the restaurant of his
dreams, and though each was a disappointment, yet
the search still went on. The place which most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
nearly coincided with his desires was the "Sceptre,"
a low, sombre room between the Law Courts and the
river, used by well-to-do managing clerks and a
sprinkling of junior barristers. Here, lounging luxuriously
on red plush seats, and in full sight and
hearing of a large silver grill, the two spent many
luncheon hours, eating slowly, with gross, sensual
enjoyment, and secretly elated by the proximity of
men older and more prosperous than themselves,
whom they met on equal terms.</p>

<p>Richard once suggested that they should try one
of the French restaurants in Soho which Mr. Aked
had mentioned.</p>

<p>"Not me!" said Jenkins, in reply. "You don't
catch me going to those parley-voo shops again. I
went once. They give you a lot of little messes,
faked up from yesterday's dirty plates, and after
you've eaten half a dozen of 'em you don't feel a
bit fuller. Give me a steak and a potato. I like
to know what I'm eating."</p>

<p>He had an equal detestation of vegetarian restaurants,
but once, during a period of financial depression,
he agreed to accompany Richard, who knew the
place fairly well, to the "Crabtree" in Charing
Cross Road, and though he grumbled roundly at the
insubstantiality of the three-course dinner <i>à la carte</i>
which could be obtained for sixpence, he made no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
difficulty, afterwards, about dining there whenever
prudence demanded the narrowest economy.</p>

<p>An air of chill and prim discomfort pervaded the
Crabtree, and the mingled odour of lentils and sultana
pudding filled every corner. The tables were
narrow, and the chairs unyielding. The customers
were for the most eccentric as to dress and demeanour;
they had pale faces, and during their melancholy
meals perused volumes obviously instructive,
or debated the topics of the day in platitudinous conversations
unspiced by a single oath. Young women
with whom their personal appearance was a negligible
quantity came in large numbers, and either
giggled to one another without restraint or sat erect
and glared at the males in a manner which cowed
even Jenkins. The waitresses lacked understanding,
and seemed to resent even the most courteous advances.</p>

<p>One day, just as they were beginning dinner,
Jenkins eagerly drew Richard's attention to the girl
at the pay-desk. "See that girl?" he said.</p>

<p>"What about her? Is she a new one?"</p>

<p>"Why, she's the tart that old Aked used to be
after."</p>

<p>"Was she at that A. B. C. shop in the Strand?"
said Richard, who began to remember the girl's features
and her reddish brown hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, that's her. Before she was at the A. B. C.
she was cashier at that boiled-beef place opposite
the Courts, but they say she got the sack for talking
to customers too much. She and Aked were very
thick then, and he went there every day. I suppose
his courting interfered with business."</p>

<p>"But he's old enough to be her father!"</p>

<p>"Yes. He ought to have been ashamed of himself.
She's not a bad kind, eh?"</p>

<p>"There wasn't anything between them, really,
was there?"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> don't know. There might have been. He
followed her to the A. B. C, and I think he sometimes
took her home. Her name's Roberts. We
used to have him on about her&mdash;rare fun."</p>

<p>The story annoyed Richard, for his short <i>tête-à-tête</i>
with Mr. Aked had remained in his mind as a
pleasant memory, and though he was aware that the
old man had been treated with scant respect by the
youngsters in the office, he had acquired the habit of
mentally regarding him with admiration, as a representative
of literature. This attachment to a restaurant
cashier, clearly a person of no refinement or intellect,
scarcely fitted with his estimate of the
journalist who had spoken to Carlyle.</p>

<p>During the meal he surreptitiously glanced at the
girl several times. She was plumper than before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
and her cough seemed to be cured. Her face was
pleasant, and undoubtedly she had a magnificent coiffure.</p>

<p>When they presented their checks, Jenkins bowed
awkwardly, and she smiled. He swore to Richard
that next time he would mention Mr. Aked's name
to her. The vow was broken. She was willing to
exchange civilities, but her manner indicated with
sufficient clearness that a line was to be drawn.</p>

<p>In the following week, when Richard happened to
be at the Crabtree alone, at a later hour than usual,
they had rather a long conversation.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Aked still at your office?" she asked,
looking down at her account books.</p>

<p>Richard told what he knew.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said, "I often used to see him, and
he gave me some lozenges that cured a bad cough
I had. Nice old fellow, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I fancy so," Richard assented.</p>

<p>"I thought I'd just ask, as I hadn't seen him
about for a long time."</p>

<p>"Good afternoon&mdash;Miss Roberts."</p>

<p>"Good afternoon&mdash;Mr.&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Larch."</p>

<p>They both laughed.</p>

<p>A trivial dispute with Jenkins, a few days later,
disclosed the fact that that haunter of bars had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
sullen temper, and that his displeasure, once aroused,
was slow to disappear. Richard dined alone again
at the Crabtree, and after another little conversation
with Miss Roberts, having time at his disposal,
he called at the public library in St. Martin's Lane.
In a half-crown review he saw an article, by a writer
of considerable repute, entitled "To Literary Aspirants,"
which purported to demonstrate that a
mastery of the craft of words was only to be attained
by a regular course of technical exercises; the nature
of these exercises was described in detail. There
were references to the unremitting drudgery of Flaubert,
de Maupassant, and Stevenson, together with
extracts chosen to illustrate the slow passage of the
last-named author from inspired incompetence to the
serene and perfect proficiency before which all difficulties
melted. After an unqualified statement
that any man&mdash;slowly if without talent, quickly if
gifted by nature&mdash;might with determined application
learn to write finely, the essayist concluded by
remarking that never before in the history of literature
had young authors been so favourably circumstanced
as at that present. Lastly came the maxim,
<i>Nulla dies sine linea</i>.</p>

<p>Richard's cooling enthusiasm for letters leaped
into flame. He had done no writing whatever for
several weeks, but that night saw him desperately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
at work. He took advantage of the quarrel to
sever all save the most formal connection with
Jenkins, dined always frugally at the Crabtree, and
spent every evening at his lodging. The thought of
Alphonse Daudet writing "Les Amoureuses" in a
Parisian garret supported him through an entire
month of toil, during which, besides assiduously practising
the recommended exercises, he wrote a complete
short story and began several essays. About
this time his "City of Sleep" was returned upon
his hands in a condition so filthy and ragged that
he was moved to burn it. The short story was
offered to an evening daily, and never heard of
again.</p>

<p>It occurred to him that possibly he possessed some
talent for dramatic criticism, and one Saturday evening
he went to the first performance of a play at
the St. George's theatre. After waiting for an hour
outside, he got a seat in the last row of the pit.
Eagerly he watched the critics take their places in
the stalls; they chatted languidly, smiling and bowing
now and then to acquaintances in the boxes and
dress circle; the pit was excited and loquacious, and
Richard discovered that nearly everyone round about
him made a practice of attending first nights, and had
an intimate knowledge of the <i>personnel</i> of the stage.
Through the hum of voices the overture to "Rosamund"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
fitfully reached him. During whole bars
the music was lost; then some salient note caught the
ear, and the melody became audible again until another
wave of conversation engulfed it.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the last act was greeted with
frenzied hand-clapping, beating of sticks, and inarticulate
cries, while above the general noise was heard
the repeated monosyllable "'thor, 'thor." After
what seemed an interminable delay the curtain was
drawn back at one side and a tall man in evening
dress, his face a dead white, stepped before the footlights
and bowed several times; the noise rose to a
thunderous roar, in which howls and hissing were
distinguishable. Richard shook from head to foot,
and tears unaccountably came to his eyes.</p>

<p>The whole of Sunday and Monday evening were
occupied in writing a detailed analysis and appreciation
of the play. On Tuesday morning he bought
a weekly paper which devoted special attention to
the drama, in order to compare his own view with
that of an acknowledged authority, and found that
the production was dismissed in ten curt lines as mere
amiable drivel.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards Mr. Curpet offered him the
position of cashier in the office, at a salary of three
pounds a week. His income was exactly doubled,
and the disappointments of unsuccessful authorship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
suddenly ceased to trouble him. He began to doubt
the wisdom of making any further attempt towards
literature. Was it not clear that his talents lay in
the direction of business? Nevertheless a large
part of his spare cash was devoted to the purchase of
books, chiefly the productions of a few celebrated old
continental presses, which he had recently learned to
value. He prepared a scheme for educating himself
in the classical tongues and in French, and the practice
of writing was abandoned to make opportunity
for the pursuit of culture. But culture proved to be
shy and elusive. He adhered to no regular course
of study, and though he read much, his progress towards
knowledge was almost imperceptible.</p>

<p>Other distractions presented themselves in the
shape of music and painting. He discovered that he
was not without critical taste in both these arts, and
he became a frequenter of concerts and picture-galleries.
He bought a piano on the hire-purchase system,
and took lessons thereon. In this and other
ways his expenditure swelled till it more than swallowed
up the income of three pounds a week which
not long before he had regarded as something very
like wealth. For many weeks he made no effort to
adjust the balance, until his debts approached the
sum of twenty pounds, nearly half of which was owing
to his landlady. He had to go through more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
than one humiliating scene before an era of economy
set in.</p>

<p>One afternoon he received a telegram to say that
William Vernon had died very suddenly. It was
signed "Alice Clayton Vernon." Mrs. Vernon was
William's stately cousin-in-law, and Richard, to whom
she had spoken only once,&mdash;soon after Mary's wedding,&mdash;regarded
her with awe; he disliked her because
he found it impossible to be at ease in her imposing
presence. As he went into Mr. Curpet's
room to ask for leave of absence, his one feeling was
annoyance at the prospect of having to meet her
again. William's death, to his own astonishment,
scarcely affected him at all.</p>

<p>Mr. Curpet readily granted him two days' holiday,
and he arranged to go down to Bursley the following
night for the funeral.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>




<h4>CHAPTER VIII</h4>


<p>Wearied of sitting, Richard folded his
overcoat pillow-wise, put it under his
head, and extended himself on the
polished yellow wood. But in vain were his eyes
shut tight. Sleep would not come, though he
yawned incessantly. The monstrous beat of the engine,
the quick rattle of windows, and the grinding
of wheels were fused into a fantastic resonance which
occupied every corner of the carriage and invaded
his very skull. Then a light tapping on the roof,
one of those mysterious sounds which make a compartment
in a night-train like a haunted room, momentarily
silenced everything else, and he wished that
he had not been alone.</p>

<p>Suddenly jumping up, he put away all idea of
sleep, and lowered the window. It was pitch dark;
vague changing shapes, which might have been either
trees or mere fancies of the groping eye, outlined
themselves a short distance away; far in front was a
dull glare from the engine, and behind twinkled the
guard's lamp.... In a few seconds he closed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the window again, chilled to the bone, though May
was nearly at an end.</p>

<p>The thought occurred to him that he was now a
solitary upon the face of the earth. It concerned no
living person whether he did evil or good. If he
chose to seek ruin, to abandon himself to the most
ignoble impulses, there was none to restrain,&mdash;not
even a brother-in-law. For several weeks past, he
had been troubled about his future, afraid to face it.
Certainly London satisfied him, and the charm of living
there had not perceptibly grown less. He rejoiced
in London, in its vistas, its shops, its unending
crowds, its vastness, its wickedness; each dream
dreamed about London in childhood had come true;
and surer than ever before was the consciousness that
in going to London he had fulfilled his destiny. Yet
there was something to lack in himself. His confidence
in his own abilities and his own character was
being undermined. Nearly a year had gone, and he
had made no progress, except at the office. Resolutions
were constantly broken; it was three months
since he had despatched an article to a newspaper.
He had not even followed a definite course of study,
and though his acquaintance with modern French
fiction had widened, he could boast no exact scholarship
even in that piquant field. Evening after evening&mdash;ah!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
those long, lamplit evenings which were to
be given to strenuous effort!&mdash;was frittered away
upon mean banalities, sometimes in the company of
some casual acquaintance and sometimes alone. He
had by no means grasped the full import and extent
of this retrogression; it was merely beginning to disturb
his self-complacence, and perhaps, ever so
slightly, his sleep. But now, hurrying to the funeral
of William Vernon, he lazily laughed at himself for
having allowed his peace of mind to be ruffled.
Why bother about "getting on"? What did it
matter?</p>

<p>He still experienced but little sorrow at the death
of Vernon. His affection for the man had strangely
faded. During the nine months that he had lived
in London they had scarcely written to one another,
and Richard regarded the long journey to attend
William's obsequies as a tiresome concession to propriety.</p>

<p>That was his real attitude, had he cared to examine
it.</p>

<p>At about four o'clock it was quite light, and the
risen sun woke Richard from a brief doze. The dew
lay in the hollows of the fields but elsewhere there
was a soft, fresh clearness which gave to the common
incidents of the flying landscape a new and virginal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
beauty&mdash;as though that had been the morn of creation
itself. The cattle were stirring, and turned to
watch the train as it slipped by.</p>

<p>Richard opened the window again. His mood
had changed, and he felt unreasonably joyous.
Last night he had been too pessimistic. Life lay
yet before him, and time enough to rectify any indiscretions
of which he might have been guilty. The
future was his, to use as he liked. Magnificent, consoling
thought! Moved by some symbolic association
of ideas, he put his head out of the window and
peered in the direction of the train's motion. A
cottage stood alone in the midst of innumerable
meadows; as it crossed his vision, the door opened,
and a young woman came out with an empty pail
swinging in her left hand. Apparently she would be
about twenty-seven, plump and sturdy and straight.
Her hair was loose about her round, contented face,
and with her disengaged hand she rubbed her eyes,
still puffed and heavy with sleep. She wore a pink
print gown, the bodice of which was unfastened, disclosing
a white undergarment and the rich hemispheres
of her bosom. In an instant the scene was
hidden by a curve of the line, and the interminable
succession of fields resumed, but Richard had time to
guess from her figure that the woman was the mother
of a small family. He pictured her husband still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
unconscious in the warm bed which she had just
left; he even saw the impress of her head on the
pillow, and a long nightdress thrown hastily across
a chair.</p>

<p>He was deeply and indescribably affected by this
suggestion of peaceful married love set in so great
a solitude. The woman and her hypothetical husband
and children were only peasants, their lives were
probably narrow and their intellects dormant, yet
they aroused in him a feeling of envy which surged
about his brain and for the moment asphyxiated
thought....</p>

<p>Later on the train slackened speed as it passed
through a shunting-yard. The steam from the light
shunting-engine rose with cloud-like delicacy in the
clear air, and an occasional short whistle seemed to
have something of the quality of a bird's note. The
men with their long poles moved blithely among the
medley of rails, signalling one another with motions
of the arm. The coupling-chains rang with a merry,
giant tinkle, and when the engine brought its load
of waggons to a standstill, and a smart, metallic
bump, bump, bump ran <i>diminuendo</i> from waggon to
waggon, one might have fancied that some leviathan
game was being played. Richard forgot the girl
with the pail, and soon after went to sleep.</p>

<p>At six o'clock the train reached Knype, where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
had to change. Two women with several children
also alighted, and he noticed how white and fatigued
were their faces; the children yawned pitifully. An
icy, searching wind blew through the station; the exhilaration
of the dawn was gone, and a spirit of
utter woe and disaster brooded over everything.
For the first time William's death really touched
him.</p>

<p>The streets of Bursley were nearly empty as he
walked through the town from the railway station,
for the industrial population was already at work in
the manufactories, and the shops not yet open. Yet
Richard avoided the main thoroughfares, choosing a
circuitous route lest he might by chance encounter
an acquaintance. He foresaw the inevitable banal
dialogue:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, how do you like London?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's fine!"</p>

<p>"Getting on all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thanks."</p>

<p>And then the effort of two secretly bored persons
to continue a perfunctory conversation unaided by a
single mutual interest.</p>

<p>A carriage was driving away from the Red House
just as Richard got within sight of it; he nodded to
the venerable coachman, who gravely touched his
hat. The owner of the carriage was Mr. Clayton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Vernon, William's cousin and an alderman of Bursley,
and Richard surmised that Mrs. Clayton Vernon
had put herself in charge of the place until the
funeral should be over. He trembled at the prospect
of a whole day to be spent in the company of
these excellent people, whom William had always referred
to with a smile, and yet not without a great
deal of respect. The Clayton Vernons were the
chief buttress of respectability in the town; rich,
strictly religious, philanthropic, and above all dignified.
Everyone looked up to them instinctively, and
had they possessed but one vice between them, they
would have been loved.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clayton Vernon herself opened the door.
She was a stately woman of advanced middle age,
with a suave, imperious manner.</p>

<p>"I left Clayton to have breakfast by himself," she
said, as she led Richard into the sitting-room; "I
thought you would like someone here to welcome you
after your long night journey. Breakfast will be
ready almost directly. How tired you must be!
Clayton said it was a pity you should come by the
night train, but of course it is quite right that you
should inconvenience your employers as little as possible,
quite right. And we admire you for it.
Now will you run upstairs and wash? You've not
forgotten the way?..."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>The details of the funeral had been settled by Mr.
Clayton Vernon, who was the chief mourner, and
Richard had nothing to do but fall in with preconcerted
plans and answer decorously when spoken to.
The arrangement was satisfactory in that it relieved
him from duties which would have been irksome, but
scarcely gratifying to his pride. He had lived nearly
all his life in that house, and had known the dead
man perhaps more intimately than anyone else present.
However, he found it convenient to efface himself.</p>

<p>In the evening there was an elaborate tea at which
were present the Clayton Vernons and the minister
who had conducted the funeral service. The
minister and the alderman left immediately afterwards
to attend a meeting, and when they were gone
Mrs. Clayton Vernon said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now we are all alone, Richard. Go into the
drawing-room and I will follow. I do want to have
a chat with you."</p>

<p>She came in with needle and thread and scissors.</p>

<p>"If you will take off your coat, I will stitch on that
button that is hanging by one thread. I noticed it
this morning, and then it went quite out of my mind.
I am so sorry!"</p>

<p>"Oh, thanks!" he blushed hotly. "But I can
stitch myself, you know&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, you needn't be shy of an old woman seeing
you in your shirt-sleeves. Do as I ask."</p>

<p>He doffed the coat.</p>

<p>"I always like young men to be immaculately
neat," she said, cutting off a piece of cotton. "One's
personal character is an index to one's character,
don't you think? Of course you do. Here, thread
the needle for me. I am afraid since your dear
sister died you have grown a little careless, eh? She
was <i>most</i> particular. Ah, what a mother she was to
you!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Richard.</p>

<p>"I was very grieved to see you go to the funeral
in a soft hat&mdash;Richard, really I was. It wasn't
respectful to your brother-in-law's memory."</p>

<p>"I never thought. You see, I started in rather
a hurry." The fact was that he had no silk hat, nor
could he easily afford to buy one.</p>

<p>"But you <i>should</i> think, my dear boy. Even Clayton
was shocked. Are those your best clothes?"</p>

<p>Richard answered that they were. He sheepishly
protested that he never bothered about clothes.</p>

<p>There was a silence, broken by her regular stitching.
At last she handed him the coat and helped him
to put it on. He went to the old green sofa, and
somewhat to his dismay she sat down by his side.</p>

<p>"Richard," she began, in a changed, soft voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
and not without emotion, "do you know we are expecting
great things from you?"</p>

<p>"But you shouldn't. I'm a very ordinary sort of
person."</p>

<p>"No, no. That you are not. God has given you
great talents, and you must use them. Poor William
always used to say that you were highly gifted
and might do great things."</p>

<p>"Might!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;if you tried."</p>

<p>"But how am I gifted? And what 'great things'
are expected?" he asked, perhaps angling for further
flattering disclosures.</p>

<p>"I cannot answer that," said Mrs. Clayton Vernon;
"it is for you to answer. You have given all
your friends the impression that you would do something
worth doing. You have raised hopes, and you
must not disappoint them. We believe in you,
Richard. That is all I can say."</p>

<p>"That's all very well; but&mdash;" He stopped and
played with the seal on his watch-chain. "The fact
is, I am working, you know. I want to be an author&mdash;at
least a journalist."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"It's a slow business&mdash;at first&mdash;" Suddenly
moved to be confidential, he went on to give her some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
account, incomplete and judiciously edited, of his life
during the past year.</p>

<p>"You have relieved my mind greatly, and Clayton
will be so glad. We were beginning to think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why were you 'beginning to think'?"</p>

<p>"Well, never mind now."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"Never mind. I have full confidence in you, and
I am sure you will get on. Poor boy, you have no
near connections or relatives now?"</p>

<p>"No, none."</p>

<p>"You must look on Clayton and myself as very
near relatives. We have no children, but our hearts
are large. I shall expect you to write to me sometimes
and to come and stay with us now and then."</p>

<h4>CHAPTER IX</h4>


<p>In the centre of the reading-room at the British
Museum sit four men fenced about by a quadruple
ring of unwieldy volumes which are an index
to all the knowledge in the world. The four
men know those volumes as a good courier knows the
Continental Bradshaw, and all day long, from early
morning, when the attendants, self-propelled on
wheeled stools, run around the rings arranging and
aligning the huge blue tomes, to late afternoon, when
the immense dome is like a dark night and the arc
lamps hiss and crackle in the silence, they answer
questions, patiently, courteously; they are seldom embarrassed
and less seldom in the wrong.</p>

<p>Radiating in long rows from the central fortress
of learning, a diversified company of readers disposes
itself: bishops, statesmen, men of science, historians,
needy pedants, popular authors whose broughams
are waiting in the precincts, journalists, medical
students, law students, curates, hack-writers, women
with clipped hair and black aprons, idlers; all short-sighted
and all silent.</p>

<p>Every few minutes an official enters in charge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
an awed group of country visitors, and whispers mechanically
the unchanging formula: "Eighty thousand
volumes in this room alone: thirty-six miles of
bookshelves in the Museum altogether." Whereupon
the visitors stare about them, the official unsuccessfully
endeavours not to let it appear that the
credit of the business belongs entirely to himself, and
the party retires again.</p>

<p>Vague, reverberating noises roll heavily from time
to time across the chamber, but no one looks up; the
incessant cannibal feast of the living upon the dead
goes speechlessly forward; the trucks of food are always
moving to and fro, and the nonchalant waiters
seem to take no rest.</p>

<p>Almost Richard's first care on coming to London
had been to obtain a reader's ticket for the British
Museum, and for several months he had made a
practice of spending Saturday afternoon there, following
no special line of study or research, and
chiefly contenting himself with desultory reading in
the twenty thousand volumes which could be reached
down without the slow machinery of an order form.
After a time the charm of the place had dwindled,
and other occupations filled his Saturday afternoons.</p>

<p>But when upon his return from William's funeral
he stepped from Euston Station into Bloomsbury,
the old enthusiasms came back in all their original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
freshness. The seduction of the street vistas, the
lofty buildings, and the swiftly flitting hansoms once
more made mere wayfaring a delight; the old feeling
of self-confident power lifted his chin, and the failures
of the past were forgotten in a dream of future
possibilities. He dwelt with pleasure on that part
of his conversation with Mrs. Clayton Vernon which
disclosed the interesting fact that Bursley would be
hurt if he failed to do "things." Bursley, and especially
Mrs. Clayton Vernon, good woman, should
not be disappointed. He had towards his native
town the sentiments of a consciously clever husband
who divines an admiring trust in the glance of a little
ignoramus of a wife. Such faith was indeed touching.</p>

<p>One of the numerous resolutions which he made
was to resume attendance at the British Museum;
the first visit was anticipated with impatience, and
when he found himself once more within the book-lined
walls of the reading-room he was annoyed to
discover that his plans for study were not matured
sufficiently to enable him to realise any definite part
of them, however small, that day. An idea for an
article on "White Elephants" was nebulous in his
brain; he felt sure that the subject might be treated
in a fascinating manner, if only he could put hands
on the right material. An hour passed in searching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Poole's Index and other works of reference, without
result, and Richard spent the remainder of the afternoon
in evolving from old magazines schemes for
articles which would present fewer difficulties in
working out. Nothing of value was accomplished,
and yet he experienced neither disappointment nor a
sense of failure. Contact with innumerable books of
respectable but forbidding appearance had cajoled
him, as frequently before, into the delusion that he
had been industrious; surely it was impossible that a
man could remain long in that atmosphere of scholarly
attainment without acquiring knowledge and improving
his mind!</p>

<p>Presently he abandoned the concoction of attractive
titles for his articles, and began to look through
some volumes of the "Biographie Universelle."
The room was thinning now. He glanced at the
clock; it was turned six. He had been there nearly
four hours! With a sigh of satisfaction he replaced
all his books and turned to go, mentally discussing
whether or not so much application did not entitle
him, in spite of certain resolutions, to go to the Ottoman
that evening.</p>

<p>"Hey!" a voice called out as he passed the glass
screen near the door; it sang resonantly among the
desks and ascended into the dome; a number of
readers looked up. Richard turned round sharply,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
and beheld Mr. Aked moving a forefinger on the
other side of the screen.</p>

<p>"Been here long?" the older man asked, when
Richard had come round to him. "I've been here
all day&mdash;first time for fifteen years at least.
Strange we didn't see each other. They've got a
beastly new regulation about novels less than five
years old not being available. I particularly wanted
some of Gissing's&mdash;not for the mere fun of reading
'em of course, because I've read 'em before. I
wanted them for a special purpose&mdash;I may tell you
about it some day&mdash;and I couldn't get them, at
least several of them. What a tremendous crowd
there is here nowadays!"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, it's Saturday afternoon," Richard
put in, "and Saturday afternoon's the only time
that most people can come, unless they're men of
independent means like yourself. You seem to have
got a few novels besides Gissing's, though." About
forty volumes were stacked upon Mr. Aked's desk,
many of them open.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I've done now." He began to
close the books with a smack and to pitch them down
roughly in new heaps, exactly like a petulant boy
handling school-books. "See, pile them between
my arms, and I bet you I'll carry them away all at
once."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no. I'll help you," Richard laughed.
"It'll be far less trouble than picking up what you
drop."</p>

<p>While they were waiting at the centre desk Mr.
Aked said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"There's something about this place that makes
you ask for more volumes than can possibly be useful
to you. I question whether I've done any good
here to-day at all. If I'd been content with three
or four books instead of thirty or forty, I might have
done something. By the way, what are you here
for?"</p>

<p>"Well, I just came to look up a few points," Richard
answered vaguely. "I've been messing about&mdash;got
a notion or two for articles, that's all."</p>

<p>Mr. Aked stopped to shake hands as soon as they
were outside the Museum. Richard was very disappointed
that their meeting should have been so
short. This man of strange vivacity had thrown a
spell over him. Richard was sure that his conversation,
if only he could be persuaded to talk, would
prove delightfully original and suggestive; he
guessed that they were mutually sympathetic. Ever
since their encounter in the A. B. C. shop Richard
had desired to know more of him, and now, when
by chance they met again, Mr. Aked's manner
showed little or no inclination towards a closer acquaintance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
There was of course a difference between
them in age of at least thirty years, but to
Richard that seemed no bar to an intimacy. It was,
he surmised, only the physical part of Mr. Aked that
had grown old.</p>

<p>"Well, good-bye."</p>

<p>"Good-bye." Should he ask if he might call at
Mr. Aked's rooms or house, or whatever his abode
was? He hesitated, from nervousness.</p>

<p>"Often come here?"</p>

<p>"Generally on Saturdays," said Richard.</p>

<p>"We may see each other again, then, sometime.
Good-bye."</p>

<p>Richard left him rather sadly, and the sound of the
old man's quick, alert footsteps&mdash;he almost stamped&mdash;receded
in the direction of Southampton Row.
A minute later, as Richard was turning round by
Mudie's out of Museum Street, a hand touched his
shoulder. It was Mr. Aked's.</p>

<p>"By the way," the man's face crinkled into a
smile as he spoke, "are you doing anything to-night?"</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever."</p>

<p>"Let's go and have dinner together&mdash;I know a
good French place in Soho."</p>

<p>"Oh, thanks. I shall be awfully pleased."</p>

<p>"Half a crown, <i>table d'hôte</i>. Can you afford?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly I can," said Richard, perhaps a little
annoyed, until he recollected that Mr. Aked had used
exactly the same phrase on a previous occasion.</p>

<p>"I'll pay for the wine."</p>

<p>"Not at all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll pay for the wine," Mr. Aked repeated decisively.</p>

<p>"All right. You told me about this Soho place
before, if you remember."</p>

<p>"So I did, so I did, so I did."</p>

<p>"What made you turn back?"</p>

<p>"A whim, young friend, nothing else. Take my
arm."</p>

<p>Richard laughed aloud, for no reason in particular,
except that he felt happy. They settled to a brisk
walk.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The restaurant was a square apartment with a low
and smoky beamed ceiling, and shining brass hat-pegs
all round the walls; above the hat-pegs were
framed advertisements of liqueurs and French, Italian,
and Spanish wines. The little tables, whose stiff
snowy cloths came near to touching the floor at every
side, gleamed and glittered in the light of a fire.
The place was empty save for an old waiter who was
lighting the gas. The waiter turned a large, mild
countenance to Mr. Aked as the two entered, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
smiling benignly greeted him with a flow of French,
and received a brief reply in the same language.
Richard failed to comprehend what was said.</p>

<p>They chose a table near the fire. Mr. Aked at
once pulled a book from his pocket and began to
read; and Richard, somewhat accustomed by this
time to his peculiarities, found nothing extraordinary
in such conduct. This plain little restaurant seemed
full of enchantment. He was in Paris,&mdash;not the
great Paris which is reached <i>via</i> Charing Cross, but
that little Paris which hides itself in the immensity
of London. French newspapers were scattered
about the room; the sound of French voices came musically
through an open door; the bread which was
presently brought in with the <i>hors d'oeuvre</i> was
French, and the setting of the table itself showed
an exotic daintiness which he had never seen before.</p>

<p>Outside a barrel organ was piercingly strident in
the misty dusk. Above the ground-glass panes of
the window, Richard could faintly descry the upper
storeys of houses on the opposite side of the road.
There was a black and yellow sign, "Umberto
Club," and above that a blue and red sign, "Blanchisserie
française." Still higher was an open window
from which leaned a young, negligently dressed
woman with a coarse Southern face; she swung a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
bird-cage idly in her hand; the bird-cage fell and was
swallowed by the ground glass, and the woman with
a gesture of despair disappeared from the window;
the barrel organ momentarily ceased its melody and
then struck up anew.</p>

<p>Everything seemed strangely, delightfully unsubstantial,
even the meek, bland face of the waiter as
he deftly poured out the soup. Mr. Aked, having
asked for the wine list, called "Cinquante, Georges,
s'il vous plait," and divided his attention impartially
between his soup and his book. Richard picked up
the "Echo de Paris" which lay on a neighbouring
chair. On the first page was a reference in displayed
type to the success of the feuilleton "<i>de notre
collaborateur distingué</i>," Catulle Mendès. How
wondrously enticing the feuilleton looked, with its
descriptive paragraphs cleverly diversified by short
lines of dialogue, and at the end "<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">CATULLE MENDÈS</span>,
<i>à suivre. Réproduction interdite!</i>"
Half Paris, probably, was reading that feuilleton!
Catulle Mendès was a real man, and no doubt eating
his dinner at that moment!</p>

<p>When the fish came, and Georges had gently
poured out the wine, Mr. Aked's tongue was loosed.</p>

<p>"And how has the Muse been behaving herself?"
he began.</p>

<p>Richard told him, with as little circumlocution as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
pride would allow, the history of the last few sterile
months.</p>

<p>"I suppose you feel a bit downhearted."</p>

<p>"Not in the least!" answered Richard, bravely,
and just then his reply was approximately true.</p>

<p>"<i>Never</i> feel downhearted?"</p>

<p>"Well, of course one gets a bit sick sometimes."</p>

<p>"Let's see, to-day's the 30th. How many words
have you written this month?"</p>

<p>"How many words!" Richard laughed. "I
never count what I do in that way. But it's not
much. I haven't felt in the humour. There was
the funeral. That put me off."</p>

<p>"I suppose you think you must write only <i>when
the mood is on you</i>." Mr. Aked spoke sarcastically,
and then laughed. "Quite a mistake. I'll give you
this bit of advice and charge nothing for it. Sit
down every night and write five hundred words descriptive
of some scene which has occurred during
the day. Never mind how tired you are; do it. Do
it for six months, and then compare the earlier work
with the later, and you'll keep on."</p>

<p>Richard drank the wisdom in.</p>

<p>"Did you do that once?"</p>

<p>"I did, sir. Everyone does it that comes to anything.
I didn't come to anything, though I made a
bit of money at one time. But then mine was a queer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
case. I was knocked over by dyspepsia. Beware
of dyspepsia. I was violently dyspeptic for twenty
years&mdash;simply couldn't write. Then I cured myself.
But it was too late to begin again." He
spoke in gulps between mouthfuls of fish.</p>

<p>"How did you cure yourself?"</p>

<p>The man took no notice of the question, and went
on:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And if I haven't written anything for twenty
years, I'm still an author at heart. In fact, I've got
something 'in the air' now. Oh! I've always had
the literary temperament badly. Do you ever catch
yourself watching instinctively for the characteristic
phrase?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't quite know what you mean."</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>Richard repeated what he had said, but Mr. Aked
was absorbed in pouring out another glass of wine.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd tell me," Richard began, after a
pause, "how you first <i>began</i> to write, or rather to
get printed."</p>

<p>"My dear little friend, I can't tell you anything
new. I wrote for several years and never sold a
line. And for what peculiar reason, should you
think? Simply because not a line was worth printing.
Then my things began to be accepted. I sold
a story first; I forget the title, but I remember there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
was a railway accident in it, and it happened to come
before the editor of a magazine just when everyone
was greatly excited about a railway smash in
the West of England. I got thirty shillings for
that."</p>

<p>"I think I should get on all right enough if only
I could sell <i>one</i> thing." Richard sighed.</p>

<p>"Well, you must wait. Why, damn it all, man!"&mdash;he
stopped to drink, and Richard noticed how his
hand shook. "How long have you been working
seriously? Not a year! If you were going in for
painting, you surely wouldn't expect to sell pictures
after only a year's study?" Mr. Aked showed a
naïve appreciation of himself in the part of a veteran
who deigns to give a raw recruit the benefit of vast
experience.</p>

<p>"Of course not," assented Richard, abashed.</p>

<p>"Well, then, don't begin to whine."</p>

<p>After the cheese Mr. Aked ordered coffee and
cognac, and sixpenny cigars. They smoked in
silence.</p>

<p>"Do you know," Richard blurted out at length,
"the fact is I'm not sure that I'm meant for writing
at all. I never take any pleasure <i>in</i> writing. It's
a confounded nuisance." He almost trembled with
apprehension as he uttered the words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"You like thinking about what you're going to
write, arranging, observing, etc.?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I like that awfully."</p>

<p>"Well, here's a secret. No writer does like writing,
at least not one in a hundred, and the exception,
ten to one, is a howling mediocrity. That's a fact.
But all the same they're miserable if they don't
write."</p>

<p>"I'm glad; there's hope."</p>

<p>When Richard had finished his coffee, it occurred
to him to mention Miss Roberts.</p>

<p>"Do you ever go to the Crabtree?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not of late."</p>

<p>"I only ask because there's a girl there who knows
you. She inquired of me how you were not long
since."</p>

<p>"A girl who knows me? Who the devil may she
be?"</p>

<p>"I fancy her name's Roberts."</p>

<p>"Aha! So she's got a new place, has she? She
lives in my street. That's how I know her. Nice
little thing, rather!"</p>

<p>He made no further remark on the subject, but
there remained an absent, amused smile on his face,
and he pulled at his lower lip and fastened his gaze
on the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>"You must come down sometime, and see me;
my niece keeps house for me," he said before they
separated, giving an address in Fulham. He wrung
Richard's hand, patted him on the shoulder, winking
boyishly, and went off whistling to himself very
quietly in the upper register.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER X</h4>


<p>The slender, badly hung gate closed of itself
behind him with a resounding clang, communicating
a little thrill to the ground.</p>

<p>In answer to his ring a girl came to the door.
She was rather short, thin, and dressed in black, with
a clean white apron. In the half light of the narrow
lobby he made out a mahogany hat-rack of conventional
shape, and on a wooden bracket a small lamp
with a tarnished reflector.</p>

<p>"No," Richard heard in a quiet, tranquil voice,
"Mr. Aked has just gone out for a walk. He
didn't say what time he should be back. Can I give
him any message?"</p>

<p>"He sent me a card to come down and see him
this afternoon, and&mdash;I've come. He said about
seven o'clock. It's a quarter past now. But perhaps
he forgot all about it."</p>

<p>"Will you step inside? He may only be away for
a minute or two."</p>

<p>"No, thanks. If you'll just tell him I've
called&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry&mdash;" The girl raised her hand and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
rested it against the jamb of the doorway; her eyes
were set slantwise on the strip of garden, and she
seemed to muse an instant.</p>

<p>"Are you Mr. Larch?" she asked hesitatingly,
just as Richard was saying good-day.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Richard.</p>

<p>"Uncle was telling me he had had dinner with
you. I'm <i>sure</i> he'll be back soon. Won't you wait
a little while?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stood aside, and Richard passed into the lobby.</p>

<p>The front room, into which he was ushered, was
full of dim shadows, attributable to the multiplicity
of curtains which obscured the small bay window.
Carteret Street and the half-dozen florid, tawny, tree-lined
avenues that run parallel to it contain hundreds
of living rooms almost precisely similar. Its dimensions
were thirteen feet by eleven, and the height of
the ceiling appeared to bring the walls, which were
papered in an undecipherable pattern of blue, even
closer together than they really were. Linoleum
with a few rugs served for a carpet. The fireplace
was of painted stone, and a fancy screen of South
African grasses hid the grate. Behind a clock and
some vases on the mantelpiece rose a confection of
walnut and silvered glass. A mahogany chiffonier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
filled the side of the room farthest from the window;
it had a marble top and a large mirror framed in
scroll work, and was littered with salt-cellars, fruit
plates, and silver nicknacks. The table, a square
one, was covered by a red cloth of flannel-like texture
patterned in black. The chairs were of mahogany
and horsehair, and matched the sofa, which stretched
from the door nearly to the window. Several prints
framed in gilt and oak depended by means of stout
green cord from French nails with great earthenware
heads. In the recess to the left of the hearth
stood a piano, open, and a song on the music-stand.
What distinguished the room from others of its type
was a dwarf bookcase filled chiefly with French
novels whose vivid yellow gratefully lightened a dark
corner next the door.</p>

<p>"Uncle is very forgetful," the girl began. There
was some sewing on the table, and she had already
taken it up. Richard felt shy and ill at ease, but
his companion showed no symptom of discomposure.
He smiled vaguely, not knowing what to reply.</p>

<p>"I suppose he walks a good deal," he said at
length.</p>

<p>"Yes, he does." There was a second pause.
The girl continued to sew quietly; she appeared to
be indifferent whether they conversed or not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"I see you are a musician."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" She laughed, and looked at his
eyes. "I sing a very little bit."</p>

<p>"Do you sing Schubert's songs?"</p>

<p>"Schubert's? No. Are they good?"</p>

<p>"Rather. They're <i>the</i> songs."</p>

<p>"Classical, I suppose." Her tone implied that
classical songs were outside the region of the
practical.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course."</p>

<p>"I don't think I care much for classical music."</p>

<p>"But you should."</p>

<p>"Should I? Why?" She laughed gaily, like
a child amused. "Hope Temple's songs are nice,
and 'The River of Years,' I'm just learning that.
Do you sing?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I don't really sing. I haven't got a
piano at my place&mdash;now."</p>

<p>"What a pity! I suppose you know a great deal
about music?"</p>

<p>"I wish I did!" said Richard, trying awkwardly
not to seem flattered.</p>

<p>A third pause.</p>

<p>"Mr. Aked seems to have a fine lot of French
novels. I wish I had as many."</p>

<p>"Yes. He's always bringing them in."</p>

<p>"And this is the latest, eh?" He picked up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
"L'Abbé Tigrane," which lay on the table by the
sewing.</p>

<p>"Yes, I fancy uncle got that last night."</p>

<p>"You read French, of course?"</p>

<p>"I! No, indeed!" Again she laughed. "You
mustn't imagine, Mr. Larch," she went on, and her
small eyes twinkled, "that I am at all like uncle.
I'm not. I've only kept house for him a little while,
and we are really&mdash;quite different."</p>

<p>"How do you mean, 'like uncle'?"</p>

<p>"Well," the quiet voice was imperceptibly raised,
"I'm not a great reader, and I know nothing of
books. I'm not clever, you know. I can't bear
poetry."</p>

<p>Richard looked indulgent.</p>

<p>"But you do read?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sometimes a novel. I'm reading 'East
Lynne.' Uncle bought it for me the other
day."</p>

<p>"And you like it?"</p>

<p>There was a timid tap at the door, and a short,
stout servant with red hands and a red face entered;
her rough, chubby forearms were bare, and she carried
a market basket. "Please, 'm," she ejaculated
meaningly and disappeared. Mr. Aked's niece excused
herself, and when she returned Richard looked
at his watch and rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm very sorry about uncle&mdash;but it's just like
him."</p>

<p>"Yes, isn't it?" Richard answered, and they exchanged
a smile.</p>

<p>He walked down Carteret Street humming a tuneless
air and twirling his stick. Mr. Aked's niece had
proved rather disappointing. She was an ordinary
girl, and evidently quite unsusceptible to the artistic
influences which subtly emanated from Mr. Aked.
But with the exception of his landlady and his landlady's
daughter, she was the first woman whom
Richard had met in London, and the interview had
been somewhat of an ordeal.</p>

<p>Yes, it was matter for regret. Suppose she had
been clever, witty, full of that "nameless charm"
with which youths invest the ideal maidens of their
dreams&mdash;with which, indeed, during the past week
he had invested her! He might have married her.
Then, guided by the experience of a sympathetic
uncle-in-law, he would have realised all his ambitions.
A vision of Mr. Richard Larch, the well-known
editor, and his charming wife, giving a dinner-party
to a carefully selected company of literary
celebrities, flitted before him. Alas! The girl's
"East Lynne," her drawing-room ballads, the mean
little serving-maid, the complacent vulgarity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
room, the house, the street, the neighbourhood, combined
effectually to dispel it.</p>

<p>He felt sure that she had no aspirations.</p>

<p>It was necessary to wait for a train at Parson's
Green station. From the elevated platform grass
was visible through a gently falling mist. The curving
rails stole away mysteriously into a general greyness,
and the twilight, assuaging every crudity of the
suburban landscape, gave an impression of vast
spaces and perfect serenity. Save for the porter
leisurely lighting the station lamps, he was alone,&mdash;alone,
as it seemed to him, in an upper world, above
London, and especially above Fulham and the house
where lived the girl who read "East Lynne." How
commonplace must she be! Richard wondered that
Mr. Aked could exist surrounded by all the banalities
of Carteret Street. Even his own lodging was more
attractive, for at least Raphael Street was within
sound of the central hum and beat of the city.</p>

<p>A signal suddenly shone out in the distance; it
might have been a lighthouse seen across unnumbered
miles of calm ocean. Rain began to fall.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XI</h4>


<p>Richard's Sabbaths had become days of
dismal torpor. A year ago, on first arriving
in London, he had projected a series of
visits to churches famous either for architectural
beauty or for picturesque ritual. A few weeks, however,
had brought tedium. He was fundamentally
irreligious, and his churchgoing proceeded from a
craving, purely sensuous, which sought gratification
in ceremonial pomps, twilight atmospheres heavy
with incense and electric with devotion, and dim perspectives
of arching stone. But these things he soon
discovered lost their fine savour by the mere presence
of a prim congregation secure in the brass armour of
self-complacency; for him the worship was spoilt by
the worshippers, and so the time came when the only
church which he cared to attend&mdash;and even to this
he went but infrequently, lest use should stale its
charm&mdash;was the Roman Catholic oratory of St.
Philip Neri, where, at mass, the separation of the
sexes struck a grateful note of austerity, and the mean
appearance of the people contrasted admirably with
the splendour of the priests' vestments, the elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
music, and the gilt and colour of altars. Here deity
was omnipotent and humanity abject. Men and
women of all grades, casting themselves down before
the holy images in the ecstatic abandonment of repentance,
prayed side by side, oblivious of everything
save their sins and the anger of a God. As a
spectacle the oratory was sublime.</p>

<p>He visited it about once a month. The mornings
of intervening Sundays were given to aimless perambulation
of the parks, desultory reading, or sleep;
there was nothing to prevent him leaving town for
the day, but he was so innocent of any sort of rural
lore that the prospect of a few hours in the country
was seldom enticing enough to rouse sufficient energy
for its accomplishment. After dinner he usually
slept, and in the evening he would take a short walk
and go early to bed. For some reason he never attempted
to work on Sundays.</p>

<p>It had rained continuously since he left Parson's
Green station on the previous night, till midday on
Sunday, and in the afternoon he was lounging half
asleep with a volume of verse on his knee, considering
whether or not to put on his hat and go out, when
Lily entered; Lily was attired for conquest, and with
her broad velvet hat and pink bows looked so unlike
a servant-girl that drowsy Richard started up, uncertain
what fairy was brightening his room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Please, sir, there's a young gentleman as wants
to see you."</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;who is it?" No one had ever called
upon him before.</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir; it's a young <i>gentleman</i>."</p>

<p>The young gentleman was ushered in. He wore
a new black frock coat, and light grey trousers which
fell in rich folds over new patent-leather boots.
The shortcomings of his linen, which was dull and
bluish in tint, were more than atoned for by the
magnificence of a new white silk necktie with heliotrope
spots. He carried a silk hat and a pair of
unworn kid gloves in one hand, and in the other a
half-smoked cigar and a stick, with whose physiognomy
Richard was quite familiar.</p>

<p>"Hello, Jenkins!"</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Mr. Larch. I was just passing
this way, and I thought I'd look you up." With
an inclination of the head more ridiculous even than
he intended, Jenkins placed his hat, stick, and gloves
on the bed, and, nicely adjusting the tails of his coat,
occupied a chair.</p>

<p>The quarrel between Richard and Jenkins had
been patched up a few days before.</p>

<p>"So this is your digs. Nice large windows!"</p>

<p>"Yes, decent windows."</p>

<p>Although these two were on terms of almost brutal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
familiarity during office hours, here each felt slightly
uncomfortable in the other's presence. Jenkins
wiped his pallid, unhealthy face with a cambric handkerchief
which he unfolded for the purpose.</p>

<p>"Been to church this morning?"</p>

<p>Meditatively Jenkins flicked some cigar-ash into
the fire-grate, and then answered, "Yes."</p>

<p>"I thought so."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because you're such a swell."</p>

<p>"Ain't I, just!" Jenkins spoke with frank delight.
"Two guineas the suit, my boy! Won't I
knock 'em in the Wal&mdash;worth Road!"</p>

<p>"But where's your ring?" Richard asked, noticing
the absence of the silver ring which Jenkins commonly
wore on his left hand.</p>

<p>"Oh! I gave it to my sister. She wanted to give
it to her young man."</p>

<p>"She's engaged, is she?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;at least I suppose she is."</p>

<p>"And when are you going to get engaged?"</p>

<p>Jenkins emitted a sound expressive of scorn.
"You don't catch me entering the holy bonds. Not
this child! It ain't all lavender, you bet. I say,
you know Miss Roberts at the veg&mdash;red-haired
tart." Jenkins was unaware that Richard had been
going regularly to the Crabtree. "I was passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
the place last night just as they were closing, and I
walked down to Charing Cross with her. I asked
her to meet me to-day somewhere, but she couldn't."</p>

<p>"You mean she wouldn't. Well, and what sort's
she?"</p>

<p>"Devilish nice, <i>I</i> tell you. But not my style.
But there's a girl I know&mdash;lives down the Camberwell
New Road. She is a treat now,&mdash;a fair treat.
About seventeen, and plump as a pigeon. I shall
see her to-night."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" said Richard, for the hundredth
time marvelling that he should be on a footing of
intimacy with Albert Jenkins. The girl at Carteret
Street, whatever her imperfections, did not use the
Cockney dialect. And her smile was certainly alluring.
Moreover, she had dignity. True, she
liked "East Lynne" and Hope Temple's songs, but
it occurred to Richard that it might be pleasanter to
listen even to these despised melodies than to remain
solitary at Raphael Street or to accompany Jenkins
on a <i>prowl</i>. Why should he not go down that
afternoon to see Mr. Aked&mdash;and his niece? He
immediately decided that he would do so.</p>

<p>"It's turned out fine," said Jenkins. "What are
you up to to-night? Will you come and have a turn
round with me?"</p>

<p>"Let me see.... The fact is, I can't."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
He fought desperately against the temptation to mention
that he proposed to call on a lady, but in vain.
Forth it must come. "I'm going to see a girl."</p>

<p>"Aha!" exclaimed Jenkins, with a terribly arch
look. "So that's the little game, eh! Who's the
mash?"</p>

<p>Richard smiled reticently.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be off." Jenkins rose, and his eye
caught Richard's little bookcase; he scanned the
titles of the volumes.</p>

<p>"Oh! Likewise ah! Zola! Now we're getting
at the secret. No wonder you're so damn
studious. Zola, indeed! Well, so long. See you
to-morrow. Give my love to the girl.... I
say, I suppose you haven't got Zola in English, have
you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Never mind. So long."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>




<h4>CHAPTER XII</h4>


<p>The little red-armed servant beamed an amiable
recognition.</p>

<p>"Very hot day!" Richard said.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, sir."</p>

<p>"Very hot day," rather louder. They were in
the passage.</p>

<p>The door of the sitting-room opened, and Mr.
Aked's niece stood before him, her finger on her lips
and her eyebrows raised in a gesture of warning.
She suddenly smiled, almost laughed. Richard remembered
that smile for a long time afterwards. It
transformed not only a girl's face, but the whole of
Carteret Street. He had never seen anything like
it. Shaking hands in silence, he followed her into the
room, and she gently closed the door.</p>

<p>"Uncle's not well," she explained. "He's asleep
now, and I don't want you to wake him. In this
house, you know, if any one speaks in the passage,
you can hear it even in the attic. Uncle was caught
in the rain last night; he has a very weak chest, and
gets bronchitis directly."</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry I disturbed you," said Richard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
"The fact is I was down this way, and I thought
I'd call." It sounded a sufficiently reasonable excuse,
he considered. "I hope you weren't asleep
too."</p>

<p>"Yes, I was dozing in this chair." She put her
head back, and drummed with her fingers lightly on
the arms of the chair. "But I'm glad you've
called."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh! Because one wants to see some one&mdash;some
one new, especially after being in a sick-room."</p>

<p>"You've been sitting up late." His tone was accusing.
It seemed to him that somehow they were
already intimate.</p>

<p>"Only till three o'clock, and I slept later this morning.
How changeable the sun is to-day!" She
moved her chair, and he saw her in profile. Her
hands were on her lap. She coaxed a foot stool into
position with her toes, and placed her feet on it.</p>

<p>"You look just like a picture in this week's 'Illustrated
London News'&mdash;I mean in general pose,"
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Do I? How nice that sounds! What is it?"</p>

<p>"Whistler's 'Portrait of his Mother.' But I
hope you don't think I think you look old."</p>

<p>"How old do I look?" She turned her head
slightly towards him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>"About twenty-three, only I imagine you're much
younger."</p>

<p>Although she did not reply, she made no pretence
of being annoyed, nor did Richard tax himself with
a <i>gaucherie</i>.</p>

<p>"It took me years to like Whistler's pictures,"
she said; and in response to Richard's surprised question
she was beginning to explain that a large part
of her life had been passed in the companionship
of works of graphic art, when a slippered step was
heard in the hall and some one fumbled with the
door-handle. Mr. Aked entered.</p>

<p>"Uncle! You wicked old man!" She sprang
up, flushed, and her eyes sparkled angrily. "Whatever
did you get up for? It's enough to kill you."</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, my child. I got up because I
didn't want to stay in bed,&mdash;exactly that." Mr.
Aked paused to take breath and sank into a chair.
"Larch, I heard your voice in the passage. Upon
my word, I quite forgot you yesterday. I suppose
Adeline's been telling you I'm seriously ill, eh? Ah!
I've had many a worse attack than this. Put that
antimacassar over my shoulders, child."</p>

<p>He had given Richard a hot, limp hand, on which
the veins formed soft ridges in the smooth, brittle
skin. His grey hair was disarranged, and he wore a
dirty, torn dressing-gown. His face had lost its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
customary alert expression; but his sunk, shining eyes
glanced with mysterious restlessness first at Richard,
then at Adeline, who, uttering no further word,
covered him well and put the hassock under his feet.</p>

<p>"Well, well, well!" he sighed and closed his eyes
wearily. The other two sat silent for a time; then
Adeline, talking very quietly, and with a composure
not quite unaffected, took up their interrupted conversation.
Richard gathered that her justifiable vexation
would remain in abeyance till he had gone.
Soon her tone grew more natural; she leaned forward
with hands clasped round one knee, and Richard
felt like a receiver of confidences as she roughly outlined
her life in the country which had come to an
end only two years ago. Were all the girls so simply
communicative, he wondered; it pleased him to decide
that they were not, and that to any other but
himself she would have been more reserved; that
there was, in fact, an affinity between them. But the
presence of her uncle, which Adeline seemed able
to ignore utterly, hindered Richard from being himself.</p>

<p>"How do you like London, after living so long in
the country?" he asked inevitably.</p>

<p>"I know practically nothing of London, real
London," she said; "but I think these suburbs are
horrid,&mdash;far duller than the dullest village. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
the people! They seem so uninteresting, to have no
character!"</p>

<p>The hoarse, fatigued voice of Mr. Aked crept
in between them. "Child!" he said&mdash;and he used
the appellation, not with the proper dignity of age,
but rather like an omniscient schoolboy, home for
the holiday, addressing a sister&mdash;"Child!"&mdash;his
eyes were still closed,&mdash;"the suburbs, even Walham
Green and Fulham, are full of interest, for those who
can see it. Walk along this very street on such a
Sunday afternoon as to-day. The roofs form two
horrible, converging straight lines I know, but beneath
there is character, individuality, enough to
make the greatest book ever written. Note the
varying indications supplied by bad furniture seen
through curtained windows, like ours" (he grinned,
opened his eyes, and sat up); "listen to the melodies
issuing lamely from ill-tuned pianos; examine the
enervated figures of women reclining amidst flower-pots
on narrow balconies. Even in the thin smoke
ascending unwillingly from invisible chimney-pots,
the flutter of a blind, the bang of a door, the winking
of a fox terrier perched on a window-sill, the colour
of paint, the lettering of a name,&mdash;in all these things
there is character and matter of interest,&mdash;truth
waiting to be expounded. How many houses are
there in Carteret Street? Say eighty. Eighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
theatres of love, hate, greed, tyranny, endeavour;
eighty separate dramas always unfolding, intertwining,
ending, beginning,&mdash;and every drama a tragedy.
No comedies, and especially no farces! Why, child,
there is more character within a hundred yards of
this chair than a hundred Balzacs could analyse in a
hundred years."</p>

<p>All the old vivacity had returned to his face; he
had been rhetorical on a favourite subject, and he
was frankly pleased with himself.</p>

<p>"You will tire yourself, uncle," said Adeline.
"Shall we have tea?"</p>

<p>Richard observed with astonishment that she was
cold and unmoved. Surely she could not be blind to
the fact that Mr. Aked was a very remarkable man
with very remarkable ideas! Why, by the way,
had those ideas never presented themselves to <i>him</i>?
He would write an article on the <i>character</i> of
Raphael Street. Unwillingly he announced that he
must go; to remain longer would be to invite himself
to tea.</p>

<p>"Sit still, Larch. You'll have a cup of tea."</p>

<p>Adeline left the room; and when she had gone,
Mr. Aked, throwing a glance after her, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of my notions of the
suburb?"</p>

<p>"They are splendid," Richard replied, glowing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's something in them, I imagine," he
agreed complacently. "I've had an idea lately of
beginning to scribble again. I know there's a book
waiting to be written on 'The Psychology of the Suburbs,'
and I don't like to see copy lying about
wasted. The old war-horse scenting the battle, you
understand." He smiled grandiosely. "'Psychology
of the Suburbs'! Fine title that! See how
the silent <i>P</i> takes away all the crudity of the alliteration;
that's because one never listens to words with
the ears alone, but with the eyes also.... But
I should need help. I want a clever chap who can
take down from dictation, and assist me in the details
of composition. I suppose you wouldn't care
to come here two or three evenings a week?"</p>

<p>Richard answered sincerely that nothing would
suit him better.</p>

<p>"I should make you joint author, of course.
'Psychology of the Suburbs,' by Richard Aked and
Richard Larch. It sounds rather catchy, and I think
it ought to sell. About four hundred octavo pages,
say a hundred thousand words. Six shillings&mdash;must
be popular in price. We might get a royalty
of ninepence a copy if we went to the right publisher.
Sixpence for me and threepence for you. Would
that do?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, perfectly!" But was not Mr. Aked running
on rather fast?</p>

<p>"Perhaps we'd better say fivepence halfpenny for
me and threepence halfpenny for you; that would be
fairer. Because you'll have to furnish ideas, you
know. 'Psychology of the Suburbs, Psychology of
the Suburbs'! Fine title! We ought to do it in
six months."</p>

<p>"I hope you'll be quite well again soon. Then
we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quite well!" he repeated sharply. "I shall be
as right as a trivet to-morrow. You don't suppose
that I can't take care of myself! We'll start at
once."</p>

<p>"You're not forgetting, Mr. Aked, that you've
never seen any of my stuff yet? Are you sure I shall
be able to do what you want?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll do. I've not seen your stuff, but I
guess you've got the literary habit. The literary
habit, that's the thing! I'll soon put you up to the
wrinkles, the trade secrets."</p>

<p>"What is your general plan of the book?" Richard
asked with some timidity, fearing to be deemed
either stupid or inquisitive at the wrong moment.
He had tried to say something meet for a great occasion,
and failed.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll go into that at our first formal conference,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
say next Friday night. Speaking roughly, each
of the great suburban divisions has, for me at any
rate, its own characteristics, its peculiar moral
physiognomy." Richard nodded appreciatively.
"Take me blindfold to any street in London, and
I'll discover instantly, from a thousand hints, where
I am. Well, each of these divisions must be
described in turn, not topographically of course,
but the inner spirit, the soul of it. See? People
have got into a way of sneering at the suburbs.
Why, the suburbs <i>are</i> London! It is alone the&mdash;the
concussion of meeting suburbs in the centre
of London that makes the city and West End
interesting. We could show how the special
characteristics of the different suburbs exert a
subtle influence on the great central spots. Take
Fulham; no one thinks anything of Fulham, but suppose
it were swept off the face of the earth the effect
would be to alter, for the seeing eye, the character
of Piccadilly and the Strand and Cheapside.
The play of one suburb on another and on the central
haunts is as regular, as orderly, as calculable, as the
law of gravity itself."</p>

<p>They continued the discussion until Adeline came
in again with a tray in her hands, followed by
the little red-armed servant. The two began to lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the cloth, and the cheerful rattle of crockery filled
the room....</p>

<p>"Sugar, Mr. Larch?" Adeline was saying, when
Mr. Aked, looking meaningly at Richard, ejaculated,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Friday then?"</p>

<p>Richard nodded. Adeline eyed her uncle distrustfully.</p>

<p>For some reason, unguessed by Richard, Adeline
left them alone during most of the evening, and in
her absence Mr. Aked continued to discourse, in
vague generalities not without a specious poetical
charm, on the subject upon which they were to collaborate,
until Richard was wholly intoxicated with
its fascinating possibilities. When he left, Adeline
would not allow Mr. Aked to go to the door, and
went herself.</p>

<p>"If I hadn't been very firm," she laughed as they
were shaking hands in the passage, "uncle would
have stood talking to you in the street for goodness
knows how long, and forgotten all about his bronchitis.
Oh, you authors, I believe you are every
one like babies." Richard smiled his gratification.</p>

<p>"Mr. Larch, Mr. Larch!" The roguish summons
came after him when he was half-way up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
street. He ran back and found her at the gate with
her hands behind her.</p>

<p>"What have you forgotten?" she questioned.
He could see her face but dimly in the twilight of
the gas-lamps.</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;my umbrella," he answered.</p>

<p>"Didn't I say you were all like&mdash;little children!"
she said, as she whipped out the umbrella
and gave it to him over the gate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Anxious at once to add something original to the
sum of Mr. Aked's observations, he purposely chose
a round-about route home, through the western parts
of Fulham and past the Salisbury hotel. It seemed
to him that the latent poetry of the suburbs arose
like a beautiful vapour and filled these monotonous
and squalid vistas with the scent and the colour of
violets, leaving nothing common, nothing ignoble.
In the upturned eyes of a shop-girl who went by on
the arm of her lover he divined a passion as pure as
that of Eugénie Grandet; on the wrinkled countenance
of an older woman he beheld only the nobility
of suffering; a youth who walked alone, smoking
a cigarette, was a pathetic figure perhaps condemned
to years of solitude in London. When there was no
one else to see, he saw Adeline,&mdash;Adeline with her
finger on her lips, Adeline angry with her uncle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Adeline pouring out tea, Adeline reaching down his
hat from the peg, Adeline laughing at the gate.
There was something about Adeline that....
How the name suited her!... Her past life,
judging from the hints she had given, must have been
interesting. Perhaps that accounted for the charm
which....</p>

<p>Then he returned to the book. He half regretted
that Mr. Aked should have a hand in it at all. He
could do it himself. Just as plainly as if the idea had
been his own, he saw the volume complete, felt the
texture of the paper, admired the disposition of the
titlepage, and the blue buckram binding; he scanned
the table of contents, and carelessly eyed the brief
introduction, which was, however, pregnant with
meaning; chapter followed chapter in orderly,
scientific fashion, and the last summoned up the whole
business in a few masterly and dignified sentences.
Already, before a single idea had been reduced to
words, "The Psychology of the Suburbs" was
finished! A unique work! Other authors had
taken an isolated spot here or there in the suburbs
and dissected it, but none had viewed them in their
complex entirety; none had attempted to extract from
their incoherence a coherent philosophy, to deal with
them sympathetically as Mr. Aked and himself had
done&mdash;or rather were to do. None had suspected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
that the suburbs were a riddle, the answer to which
was not undiscoverable. Ah, that secret, that key
to the cipher! He saw it as it might be behind a
succession of veils, flimsy obstructions which just then
baffled his straining sight, but which he would rip
and rend when the moment for effort came.</p>

<p>The same lofty sentiments occupied his brain the
next morning. He paused in the knotting of his
necktie, to look out of the window, seeking even in
Raphael Street some fragment of that psychology of
environment invented by Mr. Aked. Nor did he
search quite in vain. All the phenomena of humble
life, hitherto witnessed daily without a second
thought, now appeared to carry some mysterious
meaning which was on the point of declaring itself.
Friday, when the first formal conference was to occur,
seemed distressingly distant. But he remembered
that a very hard day's work, the casting and
completing of a gigantic bill of costs, awaited him at
the office, and he decided to throw himself into it
without reserve; the time would pass more quickly.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XIII</h4>


<p>Every solicitor's office has its great client,
whose affairs, watchfully managed by the
senior partner in person, take precedence of
all else, and whom every member of the staff regards
with a particular respect caught from the principals
themselves. Messrs. Curpet and Smythe were London
agents to the tremendous legal firm of Pontifex,
of Manchester, said to enjoy the largest practice in
the midlands; and they were excusably proud of the
fact. One of the first lessons that a new clerk learnt
in the establishment at New Serjeant's Court was that,
at no matter what expenditure of time and trouble,
Pontifex business, comprising some scores of separate
causes, must be transacted so irreproachably that old
Mr. Pontifex, by repute a terrible fellow, might
never have cause of complaint. On those mornings,
happily rare, when a querulous letter did by chance
arrive from Manchester, the whole office trembled
apprehensively, and any clerk likely to be charged
with negligence began at once to consider the advisability
of seeking a new situation.</p>

<p>The Pontifex bill of costs was made up annually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
in June. As the time drew near for presenting it,
more and more clerks were pressed into its service,
until at the last everyone found himself engaged, in
one way or another, upon this colossal account.</p>

<p>When Richard arrived at the office, he found the
immense pile of white foolscap sheets upon his table,
and next it the still higher pile of blue sheets forming
the draft bill. All was finished except the
checking of the figures and the final castings. As the
cashier and accountant, he was ultimately responsible
for this. He parcelled out the sheets, keeping the
largest share for himself, and the work began. In
every room there was a low muttering of figures,
broken by an occasional oath when someone happened
to lose the thread of an addition. The principals
hovered about, full of solicitude and encouragement,
and, according to custom on such occasions,
lunch was served on the premises at the firm's expense.
Richard continued to add while eating, keeping
his head clear and seldom making a mistake;
nothing existed for him but the column of pounds,
shillings, and pence under his eyes.</p>

<p>The pile of finished sheets grew, and soon the office
boys, commanded by Jenkins, were passing the
earlier portion of the bill through the copying-press.
As the hours went by, the helpers from other departments,
no longer required, went back to their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
neglected duties, and Richard did the last additions
alone. At length the bill was absolutely finished, and
he carried it himself to the stationer's to be sewed.
In half an hour it came back, and he laid it ceremoniously
before Mr. Curpet. The grand total
went round the office, leaping from lip to lip like the
result of an important parliamentary poll. It was
higher than in any previous year by nearly a thousand
pounds. Each of the clerks took a personal pride in
its bigness, and secretly determined to petition for
an increase of salary at the first opportunity. They
talked together in groups, discussing details, while
a comfortable lassitude spread from room to room.</p>

<p>Richard stood by the open window, absently watching
the pigeons and the cleaners at the Law Courts
opposite. In a corner an office boy, new to his work,
was stamping envelopes with slow precision.
Jenkins, with one foot on a table, was tying a shoe
lace. It had struck six ten minutes ago, and everyone
was gone except Mr. Smythe, whose departure
Jenkins awaited with impatience. The hot day subsided
slowly to a serene and lovely evening, and the
customary noises of the Strand ascended to Richard
like the pastoral hum of a valley to a dweller on a
hill, not breaking but rather completing the stillness
of the hour. Gradually his brain freed itself
from the obsession of figures, though he continued to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
muse vaguely over the bill, which had just been
posted. It would certainly be settled by cheque
within a week, for Messrs. Pontifex were invariably
prompt. That cheque, which he himself would
enter and pay into the bank, amounted to as much as
he could earn in twenty years, if he remained a clerk.
He tried to imagine the scene in which, at some future
date, he would give Mr. Curpet notice of his intention
to resign his position, explaining that he preferred
to support himself by literature. The ineffable
sweetness of such a triumph! Could he ever
realise it? He could, he must; the alternative of
eternal clerkship was not to be endured. His glance
fell on Jenkins. That poor, gay, careless, vulgar
animal would always be a clerk. The thought filled
him with commiseration, and also with pride. Fancy
Jenkins writing a book called "The Psychology of
the Suburbs"!</p>

<p>"I'm going to smoke," Jenkins said; "be blowed
to Bertie dear." (Mrs. Smythe had once addressed
her husband in the office as "Bertie dear," and
thenceforth that had been his name among the staff.)
Richard made no answer. When a minute later
Jenkins, discreetly directing his puffs to the open window,
asked him for the titles of one or two of Zola's
novels in English, and their price, he gave the required
information without turning round and in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
preoccupied tone. It was his wish at that moment
to appear dreamy. Perhaps a hint of the intellectual
difference between them would suggest itself even
to Jenkins. Suddenly a voice that seemed to be Mr.
Smythe's came from the other side of the glass partition
which separated the room from the general
corridor.</p>

<p>"Jenkins, what the devil do you mean by smoking
in the office?" The pipe vanished instantly, and
Jenkins faced his accuser in some confusion, only to
find that he had been victimised. It was Mr.
Aked.</p>

<p>"You're as gassy as ever, I see," Jenkins said with
a shade of annoyance. Mr. Aked laughed, and then
began to cough badly, bending forward with flushed
cheeks.</p>

<p>"Surely you shouldn't have left the house to-day,"
Richard said, alarmed.</p>

<p>"Why not?" The retort was almost fierce.</p>

<p>"You're not fit."</p>

<p>"Fiddlesticks! I've only got a bit of a cough."</p>

<p>Richard wondered what he had called for.</p>

<p>Jenkins began to discuss with him the shortcomings
of Mr. Smythe as an employer, and when that fruitful
subject had been exhausted there was a silence.</p>

<p>"Coming home?" Mr. Aked asked Richard, who
at once prepared to leave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>"By the way, Larch, how's the mash?" Jenkins
wore his archest manner.</p>

<p>"What mash?"</p>

<p>"Why, the girl you said you were going to see
yesterday afternoon."</p>

<p>"I never said&mdash;" Richard began, looking nervously
towards Mr. Aked.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, of course not. Do you know, Mr.
Aked, he's begun his little games with the women.
These fellows from the country&mdash;so shy and all
that&mdash;they're regular cautions when you come to
know them." But Mr. Aked made no response.</p>

<p>"I was thinking you might as well come down to-morrow
night instead of Friday," he said quietly to
Richard, who had busied himself with the locking of
a safe.</p>

<p>"To-morrow? Certainly, I shall be very glad,"
Richard answered. Evidently Mr. Aked was as
eager as himself to make a beginning of the book.
No doubt that was why he had called. Surely, together
they would accomplish something notable!</p>

<p>Jenkins had climbed on a lofty stool. He gave
vent to a whistle, and the other two observed that his
features were twisted into an expression of delirious
mirth.</p>

<p>"Aha! aha!" he grinned, looking at Richard.
"I begin to perceive. You're after the pretty niece,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
eh, Master Larch? And a nice plump little thing
she is, too! She came here once to fetch uncle
home."</p>

<p>Mr. Aked sprang instantly forward and cuffed
Jenkins' ear.</p>

<p>"It's not the first time I've had to do that, nor the
second," he said. "I suppose you never will learn
to behave yourself." Jenkins could easily have
thrashed the old man&mdash;he really looked old to-day&mdash;and
no consideration for the latter's age would
have restrained him from doing so, had not the habit
of submission acquired during those years when Mr.
Aked ruled the outer office proved stronger than his
rage. As it was, he took up a safe position behind
the stool and contented himself with words.</p>

<p>"You're a beauty, you are!" he began.
"How's the red-haired A. B. C. girl getting on?
You know, the one that lost her place at the Courts'
restaurant through you. If she hadn't been a fool,
she'd have brought an action for breach of promise.
And how many more are there? I wonder&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Aked made an uncertain dart after him, but
he vanished through the doorway, only to encounter
Mr. Smythe. With a rather servile "'d afternoon,
sir," to the latter, Mr. Aked walked rapidly out of
the office.</p>

<p>"What the devil are you all up to?" Mr. Smythe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
inquired crossly. "Is Aked after money, Larch?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, Mr. Smythe. He only called to see
me."</p>

<p>"You are a friend of his, are you?"</p>

<p>"Well, I know him."</p>

<p>"H'm! Jenkins, come and take a letter."</p>

<p>As Richard hurried down into the court, he felt exceedingly
angry with Mr. Aked. Why could not
the man be more dignified? Everyone seemed to
treat him with contempt, and the cause was not altogether
obscure. He had no dignity. Richard felt
personally aggrieved.</p>

<p>Neither of them spoke of the recent incident as
they walked down to the Temple station. Mr.
Aked, indeed, said nothing; a fit of coughing occupied
him. Somehow Richard's faith in "The Psychology
of the Suburbs" had lessened a little during
the last half-hour.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>




<h4>CHAPTER XIV</h4>


<p>"Is that you, Mr. Larch?"</p>

<p>He distinctly made out Adeline's head
and bust above him. Her white apron
was pressed against the bannisters, as with extended
arms and hands grasping the stair-rail she leaned
over to see who was below.</p>

<p>"It is, Miss Aked," he answered. "The door
was open, and so I walked in. Is anything wrong?"</p>

<p>"I've just sent Lottie out for the doctor. Uncle
is very ill. I wish you'd see that he comes at once.
It's in the Fulham Road, a little to the left&mdash;you'll
notice the red lamp."</p>

<p>As Richard ran out, he met the doctor, a youngish
man with a Scots face and grey hair, hurrying down
the street, the servant-girl breathless in the rear.</p>

<p>"Master was took ill last night, sir," the latter
said, in answer to Richard's question. "Pneumonia,
the doctor says as it is, and something else, and
there's coming a nurse to-night. Master has attacks
of it, sir&mdash;he can't get his breath."</p>

<p>He stood in the passage, uncertain what to do; the
doctor had already gone upstairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>"It must be very serious," he murmured.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." Lottie began to whimper. Richard
said he would call again later to make inquiries, and
presently discovered himself in Fulham Road, walking
slowly towards Putney.</p>

<p>Mr. Aked's case was hopeless; of that Richard
felt sure. The man must be getting on in years,
and his frame, not constitutionally vigorous, had
doubtless been fatally weakened by long-continued
carelessness. What a strange creature of whims
and enthusiasms he was! Although there could be
no question as to his age, Richard never regarded
him as more than a few years older than himself.
He had none of the melancholy, the circumspection,
the fixity of view, the prudent tendency towards compromise,
the serene contented apathy, which usually
mark his time of life. He was still delicately susceptible
to new influences, his ideals were as fluid as
Richard's own. Life had taught him scarcely anything,
and least of all sagacity and a dignified carriage.
He was the typical bachelor, whose deeper
feelings have never been stirred. Did regrets for
a possibly happier past, shadows of dead faces, the
memory of kisses, ever ruffle his equanimity? Richard
thought not. He must always have lived in the
present. But he was an artist: though somehow the
man had descended in his estimation, Richard clung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
to that. He possessed imagination and he possessed
intellect, and he could fuse them together. Yet he
had been a failure. Viewed in certain lights, Richard
admitted he was a pitiful figure. What was
his true history? Richard felt instinctively that
none could answer that question, even in outline,
except Mr. Aked, and suddenly he discerned that
the man's nature, apparently frank to immodesty,
had its own reserves, the existence of which few ever
suspected. And when the worst was said, Mr.
Aked possessed originality; in an incongruous way he
still retained the naïve graces of youthfulness; he
was inspiring, and had exerted influences for which
Richard could not but be grateful.</p>

<p>"The Psychology of the Suburbs" had receded
swiftly into the background, a beautiful, impossible
idea! Richard knew now that it could never have
been carried out. A little progress would have
been made, and then, as difficulties increased, both
he and Mr. Aked would have tacitly abandoned
their enterprise. They were very much alike, he
thought, and the fancied similarity pleased him.
Perhaps at some future time he might himself carry
the undertaking to completion, in which case he
would dedicate his book to the memory of Mr.
Aked. He did not regret that the dream of the last
few days was ended. It had been very enjoyable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
but the awakening, since according to his present
wisdom it must have occurred sooner or later, was
less unpleasant now than it could have been at any
more advanced stage. Moreover, it was pleasant to
dream of the dream.</p>

<p>Mr. Aked was dying: he knew it from Adeline's
tone. Poor Adeline! To whom would she turn?
She had implied that the only relatives for whom she
cared, these being on her mother's side, were in
America. From whom would she seek assistance?
Who would conduct the formalities of the funeral,
and the testamentary business, such as it was? His
loathing for funerals seemed to have vanished, and
he was not without hope that Adeline, though their
acquaintance was of the shortest, might engage his
help for her helplessness. And after the funeral,
what would she do? Since she would probably have
enough to live upon, she might elect to remain where
she was. In which case he would visit her now and
then of an evening. Her imminent loneliness gave
her a pathetic charm, and he made haste to draw a
picture of himself and her on either side the fireplace
talking familiarly while she knitted or sewed.</p>

<p>Yes, he was actually a grown man, and entitled
to his romances. He might eventually fall in love
with her, having discovered in her character rare
qualities now unsuspected. It was improbable, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
not impossible, and he had, in fact, already glanced
at the contingency several times before. Oh for a
passion, a glorious infatuation, even if it ended in
disaster and ruin! The difficulty was that Adeline
fell short of the ideal lover. That virginal abstraction
was to have been an artist of some sort,
absolutely irreligious, broad in social views, the essence
of refinement, with a striking but not necessarily
beautiful face, soft-spoken, and isolated&mdash;untrammelled
by friends. Adeline was no artist; he
feared she might be a regular attendant at chapel
and painfully orthodox as to the sexual relations.
Was she refined? Had she a striking face? He
said Yes, twice. Her voice was low and full of
pretty modulations. Soon, perhaps, she would be
alone in the world. If only she had been an artist....
That deficiency, he was afraid, would
prove fatal to any serious attachment. Still, it
would be good to visit her.</p>

<p>He was crossing Putney Bridge. Night had
fallen, and the full brilliant moon showed a narrow
stream crawling between two broad flats of mud.
Just below the bridge a barge lay at anchor; the
silhouette of a man moved leisurely about on it, and
then a boat detached itself from the stem of the
barge and dropped down river into darkness. On
the bridge busses and waggons rattled noisily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Young men with straw hats and girls in white
blouses and black skirts passed to and fro in pairs,
some chattering, some silent. The sight of these
couples gave Richard an idea for the abandoned
"Psychology of the Suburbs." What if Mr. Aked
recovered? He remembered his sister telling him
that their grandfather had survived after having
been three times surrendered to death by the doctors.
"The Psychology of the Suburbs" began to
attract him. It might come to completion, if Mr.
Aked lived, and then.... But what about
those evenings with the lonely Adeline? The two
vistas of the future clashed with and obscured each
other, and he was overcome by vague foreboding.
He saw Mr. Aked struggling for breath in the mean
suburban bedroom, and Adeline powerless at his
side. The pathos of her position became intolerable.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When he got back to Carteret Street, it was she
who came to the door.</p>

<p>"How is he?"</p>

<p>"About the same. The nurse has come. She
told me to go to bed at once, but I don't feel as if
I wanted to sleep. You will sit down a little?"</p>

<p>She took the rocking-chair, and leaning back with
a gesture of lassitude rocked gently; her white face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
with the red eyes and drooping eyelids, gave sign of
excessive fatigue, and on her lips there was a gloomy
pout. After she had described Mr. Aked's condition
in some detail and told what the doctor had
said, they sat silent for a while in that tense atmosphere
which seems to stifle vitality in a house of
dangerous sickness. Overhead the nurse moved
about, making the window rattle softly now and
then.</p>

<p>"You have known uncle a long time, haven't
you?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," Richard answered. "It's a very
funny thing, but though I seem to know him quite
well, I've not met him half a dozen times in my
life. I saw him first about a year ago, and then I
met him again the other day at the British Museum,
and after we'd had dinner together we were just
like old friends."</p>

<p>"I certainly thought from what he said that you
<i>were</i> old friends. Uncle has so few friends. Except
one or two neighbours I do believe you are the
first person that has ever called at this house since I
came to live here."</p>

<p>"At any rate, we have soon got to know each
other," said Richard, smiling. "It isn't a week
since you asked me if my name was Larch." She
returned the smile, though rather mechanically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps my mistake about your being an old
friend of Uncle Aked's explains that," she said.</p>

<p>"Well, we won't bother about explaining it; there
it is, and if I can help you in any way just now,
you must tell me."</p>

<p>"Thank you, I will." She said it with perfect
simplicity. Richard was conscious of a scarcely perceptible
thrill.</p>

<p>"You must have had an awful time last night, all
alone," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I was too annoyed to feel upset."</p>

<p>"Annoyed?"</p>

<p>"Because uncle has brought it all on himself by
carelessness. I do think it's a shame!" She
stopped rocking, and sat up, her face full of serious
protest.</p>

<p>"He's not the sort of man to take care of himself.
He never thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's just it. He should have thought, at his
age. If he dies, he will practically have killed himself,
yes, killed himself. There's no excuse, going
out as he did, in spite of all I said. Fancy him
coming downstairs last Sunday in the state he was,
and then going out on Monday, though it <i>was</i>
warm!"</p>

<p>"Well, we'll hope he will get better, and it may
be a lesson to him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hark! What was that?" She sprang to her
feet apprehensively and listened, her breast pulsing
beneath the tight black bodice and her startled inquiring
eyes fixed on Richard's. A very faint tinkle
came from the rear of the house.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the front-door bell," he suggested.</p>

<p>"Of course. How silly of me! I fancied....
Who can it be at this time?" She went
softly into the passage. Richard heard the door
open, and then a woman's voice, which somehow
seemed familiar,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How is Mr. Aked to-night? Your servant told
our servant that he was ill, and I felt anxious."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Adeline exclaimed, discomposed for a
moment, as it seemed to Richard; then she went on
coldly, "Uncle is about the same, thank you," and
almost immediately closed the door.</p>

<p>"A person to inquire about uncle," she said to
Richard, with a peculiar intonation, on re-entering
the room. Then, just as he was saying that he
must go, there was a knock on the ceiling and she
flew away again. Richard waited in the passage
till she came downstairs.</p>

<p>"It's nothing. I thought he was dying! Oh!"
and she began to cry freely and openly, without attempting
to wipe her eyes.</p>

<p>Richard gazed hard at the apron string loosely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
encircling her waist; from that white line her
trembling bust rose like a bud from its calyx, and
below it the black dress flowed over her broad hips
in gathered folds; he had never seen a figure so exquisite,
and the beauty of it took a keener poignancy
from their solitude in the still, anxious night&mdash;the
nurse and the sick man were in another sphere.</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better go to bed?" he said.
"You must be tired out and over-excited." How
awkward and conventional the words sounded!</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XV</h4>


<p>In Adeline's idiosyncrasy there was a subtle,
elusive suggestion of singularity, of unexpectedness,
which Richard in spite of himself found
very alluring, and he correctly attributed it, in some
degree, to the peculiar circumstances of her early
life, an account of which, with characteristic quaintness,
she had given him at their second meeting.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The posthumous child of Richard Aked's brother,
Adeline, who had no recollection of her mother,
lived at first with her maternal grandparents and
two uncles. She slept alone at the top of the house,
and when she arose in the morning from the big bed
with its red curtains and yellow tassels, she always
ran to the window. Immediately below here were
the leads which roofed the great projecting windows
of the shop. It was her practice at night to
scatter crumbs on the leads, and sometimes she
would be early enough to watch the sparrows pecking
them; more often all the crumbs had vanished
while she was yet asleep. The Square never failed
to interest her in the morning. In the afternoon it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
seemed torpid and morose; but before dinner, more
especially on Saturdays and Mondays, it was gaily
alert&mdash;full of canvas-covered stalls, and horses and
carts, and heaped piles of vegetables, and pigs
grunting amidst straw, and rough rosy-faced men,
their trousers tied at the knees with string, who
walked about heavily, cracking whips. These
things arrived mysteriously, before the sun, and in
the afternoon they dwindled imperceptibly away;
the stalls were unthatched, the carts jolted off one
by one, and the pigs departed squeaking, until at
five o'clock the littered Square was left deserted and
forlorn. Now and again a new stall, unfolding vivid
white canvas, stood out brightly amid its soiled companions;
then Adeline would run downstairs to her
favourite uncle, who had breakfast at 7.30 so that
he might be in charge of the shop while the rest
were at table: "Uncle Mark, Uncle Mark, there
is a new stall up at the top of the Square, near the
New Inn!" "Perhaps it is only an old one with
its face washed," Uncle Mark would say; and Adeline,
raising her right shoulder, would put her head
on it and laugh, screwing up her eyes.</p>

<p>In those days she was like a little Puritan girl,
with her plain frocks and prim gait. Her black
hair, confined by a semicircular comb which stretched
from ear to ear over the top of her head, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
brushed straight away from her forehead, and fell
across the entire width of her shoulders in glossy,
wavy lines. Her grey eyes were rather large, except
when she laughed, and they surveyed people
with a frank, inquiring look which frightened some
of the commercial travellers who came into the shop
and gave her threepenny bits; it seemed as if all
one's secret shames stood revealed to that artless
gaze. Her nose was short and flattened, but her
mouth happened to be perfect, of exactly the classic
form and size, with delectable lips half hiding the
small white teeth.</p>

<p>To her the house appeared to be of immense proportions;
she had been told that once, before she
was born, it was three houses. Certainly it possessed
more than the usual number of staircases, and
one of these, with the single room to which it gave
access, was always closed. From the Square, the
window of the disused chamber, obscured and bare,
contrasted strangely with the clear panes, white
blinds, and red pads of the others. This room was
next to her own, the two staircases running parallel;
and the thought of its dread emptiness awed her at
nights. One Saturday night in bed she discovered
that grandma, who had been plaiting her hair for
Sunday, had left a comb sticking in it. She called
aloud to grandma, to Uncle Mark, to Uncle Luke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
in vain. None of them came to her; but she distinctly
heard an answering cry from the shut room.
She ceased to call, and lay fearfully quiet for a while;
then it was morning, and the comb had slipped out
of her hair and down into the bed.</p>

<p>Beneath the house were many cellars. One
served for kitchen, and Adeline had a swing there,
hung from a beam; two others were larders; a
fourth held coal, and in a fifth ashes were thrown.
There were yet two more under the shop, to be
reached by a separate flight of stone steps. Uncle
Mark went down those steps every afternoon to turn
on the gas, but he would never allow Adeline to go
with him. Grandma, indeed, was very cross if,
when the door leading to the steps happened to be
open, Adeline approached within a yard of it.
Often, chattering to the shop-girls, who at quiet
times of the day clustered round the stove with their
sewing, she would suddenly think of the cellars below,
and her heart would seem to stop.</p>

<p>If the shutters were up, the shop was even more
terribly mysterious than either the cellars or the
disused room. On Sunday afternoons, when
grandpa snored behind a red and yellow handkerchief
in the breakfast-room, it was necessary for
Adeline to go through the shop and up the show-room
staircase, in order to reach the drawing-room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
because to get to the house staircase would involve
disturbing the sleeper. How strange the shop
looked as she hurried timorously across! A dim
twilight, worse than total darkness, filtered through
the cracks of the shutters, showing faintly the sallow
dust-sheets which covered the merinos and the
chairs on the counters, and she always reached the
show-room, which had two large, unobstructed windows,
with a sob of relief. Very few customers
were asked into the show-room; Adeline employed
it on weekdays as a nursery; here she nursed her
dolls, flew kites, and read "Little Wideawake," a
book given to her by a commercial traveller; there
was a cheval glass near the front window in which
she contemplated herself long and seriously.</p>

<p>She never had the companionship of other children,
nor did she desire it. Other children, she understood,
were rude and dirty; although Uncle
Mark and Uncle Luke taught in the Sunday-school,
and grandpa had once actually been
superintendent, she was not allowed to go
there, simply because the children were rude
and dirty. But she went to morning chapel,
sitting alone with grandpa on the red cushions of
the broad pew, that creaked every time she moved;
Uncle Mark and Uncle Luke sat away up in the gallery
with the rude and dirty Sunday-school children;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
grandma seldom went to chapel; the ministers called
to see her instead. Once to her amazement Uncle
Luke had ascended the pulpit stairs, looking just as
if he was walking in his sleep, and preached. It
seemed so strange, and afterwards the religious
truths which she had been taught somehow lost their
awfulness and some of their reality. On Sunday
evenings she celebrated her own private service, in
which she was preacher, choir, organist, and congregation.
Her extempore prayers were the secret
admiration of grandma, who alone heard them.
Adeline stayed up for supper on Sundays. When
the meal was over, grandpa opened the big Bible,
and in his rich, heavy voice read that Shem begat
Arphaxad and Arphaxad begat Salah and Salah begat
Eber and Eber begat Pelag, and about the Ammonites
and the Jebusites and the Canaanites and
the Moabites; and then they knelt, and he prayed
for them that rule over us, and widows and orphans;
and at the word "orphans," grandma, who didn't
kneel like the others but sat upright in her rocking-chair
with one hand over her eyes, would say
"Amen, Amen," under her breath. And after it
was all over Adeline would choose whether Uncle
Mark or Uncle Luke should carry her to bed.</p>

<p>Grandpa died, and then grandma, and Aunt
Grace (who was not an aunt at all, but a cousin)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
came to stay with Adeline and her uncles, and one
day the shutters of the shop were put up and not
taken down again. Adeline learnt that Uncle Mark
and Uncle Luke were going a long way off, to America,
and that she was to live in future with Aunt
Grace in a large and splendid house full of coloured
pictures and statues and books. It seemed odd
that Aunt Grace, whose dresses were rather shabby,
should have a finer house than grandpa's, until
Uncle Mark explained that the house did not really
belong to Aunt Grace; Aunt Grace merely kept it in
order for a rich young gentleman who had fifteen
servants.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When she had recovered from the parting with
her uncles, Adeline accepted the change with docility.
Long inured as she was to spiritual solitude
(for the closest friendship that can exist between a
child and an adult comprises little more than an
affectionate tolerance on either side, and certainly
knows nothing of those intimate psychic affinities
which attract child to child or man to man), she
could not, indeed, have easily found much hardship
in the conditions of her new life. One matter
troubled her at first, namely, that Aunt Grace never
prayed or read the Bible or went to chapel; nor, so
far as Adeline knew, did anyone else at the Abbey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
But she soon became reconciled to this state of
things. For a time she continued to repeat her
prayers; then the habit ceased.</p>

<p>The picture-gallery, of which she had heard a
great deal, fascinated her at once. It was a long
but not very lofty apartment, receiving daylight
from a hidden source, hung with the finest examples
of the four great Italian schools which flourished
during the first half of the sixteenth century: the
Venetian, a revel of colour; the Roman, dignified
and even sedate; the Florentine, nobly grandiose;
and the school of Parma, mysteriously delicate.
Opportunity serving, she spent much of her time
here, talking busily to the madonnas, the Christs,
the martyred saints, the monarchs, the knights, the
lovely ladies, and all the naïve mediæval crowd,
giving each of them a part in her own infantile romances.
When she grew older, she copied&mdash;who
shall say whether consciously or unconsciously?&mdash;the
attitudes and gestures of the women; and
perhaps in time there passed into Adeline, by some
ineffable channel, at least a portion of their demure
grace and contented quietude. There were pictures
also in the square library, examples of quite modern
English and French work, sagaciously chosen by one
whose critical faculty had descended to him through
four generations of collectors; but Adeline had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
eyes for these. The books, however, gorgeous
prisoners in glass, were her good friends, though
she might never touch them, and though the narrow,
conventional girl's education assiduously bestowed
upon her by her aunt in person, stifled rather than
fostered curiosity with regard to their contents.</p>

<p>When Adeline was about nineteen, her guardian
became engaged to be married to a middle-aged
farmer, a tenant of the Abbey, who made it clear
that in espousing Aunt Grace he was not eager to
espouse Aunt Grace's <i>protégée</i> also. A serious
question arose as to her future. She had only one
other relative in England, Mr. Aked, and she passively
accepted his timely suggestion that she should
go to London and keep house for him.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XVI</h4>


<p>On the Wednesday evening Richard took
tea at the Crabtree, so that he might go
down by train to Parson's Green direct
from Charing Cross. The coffee-room was almost
empty of customers; and Miss Roberts, who appeared
to be in attendance there, was reading in the
"cosy corner," an angle of the room furnished with
painted mirrors and a bark bench of fictitious rusticity.</p>

<p>"What are you doing up here?" he asked, when
she brought his meal. "Aren't you cashier downstairs
any longer?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she said, "I should just think I was.
But the girl that waits in this room, Miss Pratt,
has her half-holiday on Wednesdays, and I come
here, and the governor takes my place downstairs.
I do it to oblige him. He's a gentleman, he is.
<i>That</i> polite! I have my half-holiday on Fridays."</p>

<p>"Well, if you've nothing else to do, what do you
say to pouring out my tea for me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can't you pour it out yourself? Poor thing!"
She smiled pityingly, and began to pour out the tea.</p>

<p>"Sit down," Richard suggested.</p>

<p>"No, thank you," she said. "There! If it
isn't sweet enough, you can put another lump in
yourself;" and she disappeared behind the screen
which hid the food-lift.</p>

<p>Presently he summoned her to make out his check.
He was debating whether to tell her that Mr. Aked
was ill. Perhaps if he did so she might request to
be informed how the fact concerned herself. He
decided to say nothing, and was the more astonished
when she began:</p>

<p>"Did you know Mr. Aked was very ill?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Who told you?"</p>

<p>"Why, I live near him, a few doors away&mdash;didn't
I tell you once?&mdash;and their servant told
ours."</p>

<p>"Told your servant?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Miss Roberts, reddening a little, and
with an inflection which meant, "I suppose you
thought <i>my</i> family wouldn't have a servant!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" He stopped a moment, and then an
idea came to him. "It must have been you who
called last night to inquire!" He wondered why
Adeline had been so curt with her.</p>

<p>"Were you there then?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I know the Akeds pretty well."</p>

<p>"The doctor says he'll not get better. What do
you think?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's a bad lookout."</p>

<p>"Very sad for poor Miss Aked, isn't it?" she
said, and something in the tone made Richard look
up at her.</p>

<p>"Yes," he agreed.</p>

<p>"Of course you like her?"</p>

<p>"I scarcely know her&mdash;it's the old man I
know," he replied guardedly.</p>

<p>"Well, if you ask me, I think she's a bit stand-offish."</p>

<p>"Perhaps that's only her manner."</p>

<p>"You've noticed it too, have you?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit. I've really seen very little of her."</p>

<p>"Going down again to-night?"</p>

<p>"I may do."</p>

<p>Nothing had passed between Adeline and himself
as to his calling that day, but when he got to Carteret
Street she evidently accepted his presence as a
matter of course, and he felt glad. There was noting
in her demeanour to recall the scene of the
previous night. He did not stay long. Mr. Aked's
condition was unchanged. Adeline had watched by
him all day, while the nurse slept, and now she confessed
to an indisposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>"My bones ache," she said, with an attempt to
laugh, "and I feel miserable, though under the circumstances
there's nothing strange in that."</p>

<p>He feared she might be sickening towards influenza,
caught from her uncle, but said nothing,
lest he should alarm her without cause. The next
day, however, his apprehension was justified. On
his way to the house in the evening he met the doctor
at the top of Carteret Street and stopped him.</p>

<p>"You're a friend of Mr. Aked's, eh?" the doctor
said, examining Richard through his gold-rimmed
spectacles. "Well, go and do what you
can. Miss Aked is down with the influenza now,
but I don't think it will be a severe attack if she
takes care. The old fellow's state is serious. You
see, he has no constitution, though perhaps that's
scarcely a disadvantage in these cases; but when it
comes to double basic pneumonia, with fever, and
cardiac complications, pulse 140, respiration 40,
temperature 103 to 104, there's not a great deal of
chance. I've got a magnificent nurse, though, and
she'll have her hands full. We ought really to
send for another one, especially as Miss Aked wants
looking after too.... Bless you," he went
on, in answer to a question from Richard, "I can't
say. I injected strychnia this morning, and that has
given relief, but he may die during the night. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
the other hand he may recover. By the way, they
seem to have no relations, except a cousin of Mr.
Aked's who lives in the north. I've wired to her.
Good evening. See what you can do. I'm due in
my surgery in two minutes."</p>

<p>Richard introduced himself to the nurse, explained
that he had seen the doctor, and asked if he
could render assistance. She was a slender girl of
about twenty-three, with dark, twinkling eyes and
astonishingly small white ears; her blue uniform,
made of the same print as a servant's morning-dress,
fitted without a crease, and her immense apron was
snowy. On one linen cuff was a stain; she noticed
this while talking to Richard, and adroitly reversed
the wristband under his very gaze.</p>

<p>"I suppose you know the Akeds pretty well?"
she questioned.</p>

<p>"Well, pretty well," he answered.</p>

<p>"Do you know any friends of theirs, women,
who happen to live near?"</p>

<p>"I feel fairly sure they have practically no acquaintances.
I have never met any people here."</p>

<p>"It is very awkward, now that Miss Aked is taken
ill."</p>

<p>The mention of Adeline gave him an opportunity
to make more particular inquiries as to her condition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is nothing to be afraid of," the nurse
said, "only she must stay in bed and keep quite
quiet."</p>

<p>"I fancied last night she looked ill," he said
sagely.</p>

<p>"You were here last night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and the night before."</p>

<p>"Oh! I wasn't aware&mdash;" The nurse stopped
a moment. "Pardon me, if I am indiscreet, but
are you engaged to Miss Aked?"</p>

<p>"No," said Richard shortly, uncertain whether
or not he was blushing. The nurse's eyes twinkled,
but otherwise her impassive gravity suffered
no diminishment. "Not at all," he added. "I
am merely a friend, anxious to do anything I
can."</p>

<p>"I will get you to do some marketing for me,"
she decided suddenly. "The maid is sitting with
Mr. Aked&mdash;he's a little easier for the moment&mdash;and
Miss Aked, I think, is asleep. If I give you a
list, can you discover the shops? I am quite ignorant
of this neighbourhood."</p>

<p>Richard thought he could discover the shops.</p>

<p>"In the meantime I will have a bath. I have
had no rest worth mentioning for twenty-four hours,
and I want freshening up. Don't come back for
twenty minutes, or there will be no one to let you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
in. Stay, I will give you the latch-key." It was
attached to her chatelaine.</p>

<p>Equipped with written orders and a sovereign,
he went out. Though he was away barely a quarter
of an hour, she was dressed and downstairs again
when he came in, her face as radiant as if she had
just risen. She counted the change, and checked
the different purchases with the list. Richard had
made no mistakes.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said very formally. He had
expected a little praise.</p>

<p>"Is there anything else I can do?" he asked, determined
not to weary in good works, however
coldly his efforts were received.</p>

<p>"I think you might sit with Mr. Aked for a
while," she said; "I must positively give some attention
to Miss Aked, and half an hour's rest would
not harm me. See, there are some slippers; would
you mind taking off your boots and putting those on
instead? Thank you. You may talk to Mr. Aked
if he talks to you, and let him hold your hand&mdash;he'll
probably want to. Let him have just a sip of
the brandy and milk I will give you, whenever he
asks for it. Don't mind if he grumbles at everything
you do. Try to soothe him. Remember he
is very seriously ill. Shall I take you upstairs?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked at Richard and then at the door; and
Richard, hesitating for a fraction of a second,
stepped past her to open it. He managed it awkwardly
because he had never done such a thing for
a lady in his life, nor could he quite understand what
mysterious prompting had led him to be so punctilious
now. The nurse bowed acknowledgment and
preceded him to the sick-room. He felt as a student
feels just before the examination papers are
handed round.</p>

<p>A smell of linseed escaped from the bedroom as
the nurse pushed open the door.</p>

<p>"Stay outside a moment," she said to Richard.
He could see the grate, on which a kettle was singing
over a small fire. In front of the fire was a board,
with a large bowl and spoon, and some pieces of
linen. Then he was conscious of nothing but a loud
sound of rapid, painful breathing, accompanied by
moans and a strange rattling which came to his ears
with perturbing distinctness. He knew nothing of
sickness beyond what people had told him, and these
phenomena inspired him with physical dread. He
wished to run away.</p>

<p>"A friend of yours is coming to sit with you, Mr.
Aked&mdash;you know Mr. Larch," he heard the nurse
say; she was evidently busy about the bed. "You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
can go now, Lottie," she went on to the servant.
"Wash up the things I have put in the sink, and
then off to bed."</p>

<p>Richard waited with painful expectancy for the
voice of Mr. Aked.</p>

<p>"Larch&mdash;did you say&mdash;why&mdash;didn't he come&mdash;before?"
The tones were less unnatural than
he had anticipated, but it seemed that only by the
exercise of a desperate ingenuity could the speaker
interject the fragments of a sentence here and there
between his hurrying gasps.</p>

<p>Then the servant went downstairs.</p>

<p>"Come in, Mr. Larch," the nurse called pleasantly.</p>

<p>The patient, supported by pillows, was sitting upright
in bed, and as Richard entered he looked towards
the door with the expression of an unarmed
man on the watch for an assassin. His face was
drawn and duskily pale, but on each cheek burned a
red flush; at every cruel inspiration the nostrils dilated
widely, and the shoulders were raised in a
frenzied effort to fill the embarrassed lungs.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Aked," Richard greeted him, "here
I am, you see."</p>

<p>He made no reply beyond a weak nod, and signed
to the nurse for the feeding-cup of brandy and
milk, which she held to his mouth. Richard was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
afraid he might not be able to stay in the room, and
marvelled that the nurse could be unmoved and
cheerful in the midst of this piteous altercation with
death. Was she blind to the terror in the man's
eyes?</p>

<p>"You had better sit here, Mr. Larch," she said
quietly, pointing to a chair by the bedside. "Here
is the drink; hold the cup&mdash;so. Ring this bell if
you want me for anything." Then she noiselessly
disappeared.</p>

<p>No sooner had he sat down than Mr. Aked seized
his shoulder for support, and each movement of the
struggling frame communicated itself to Richard's
body. Richard suddenly conceived a boundless
respect for the nurse, who had watched whole nights
by this tortured organism on the bed. Somehow existence
began to assume for him a new and larger
aspect; he felt that till that moment he had been going
through the world with his eyes closed; life was
sublimer, more terrible, than he had thought. He
abased himself before all doctors and nurses and
soldiers in battle; they alone tasted the true savour
of life.</p>

<p>Art was a very little thing.</p>

<p>Presently Mr. Aked breathed with slightly less
exertion, and he appeared to doze for a few moments
now and then, though Richard could scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
believe that any semblance of sleep was possible to a
man in his condition.</p>

<p>"Adeline?" he questioned once.</p>

<p>"She's getting on fine," Richard said soothingly.
"Would you like a sip?"</p>

<p>He put his grey lips clumsily round the lip of the
cup, drank, and then pushed the vessel away with a
gesture of irritation.</p>

<p>The windows were open, but the air was perfectly
still, and the gas burnt without a tremor between
the windows and the door.</p>

<p>"I'm stifled," the patient gasped. "Are they&mdash;doing&mdash;all
they can&mdash;for me?"&mdash;Richard
tried to reassure him.</p>

<p>"It's all over&mdash;with me&mdash;Larch&mdash;I can't&mdash;keep
it up long&mdash;I'm going&mdash;going&mdash;they'll
have to try&mdash;something else."</p>

<p>His lustrous eyes were fastened on Richard with
an appealing gaze. Richard turned away.</p>

<p>"I'm frightened&mdash;I thought I shouldn't be&mdash;but
I am. Doctor suggested parson&mdash;it's not that&mdash;I
said no.... Do you think&mdash;I'm dying?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit," said Richard.</p>

<p>"That's a lie&mdash;I'm off.... It's a big
thing,&mdash;death&mdash;everyone's afraid&mdash;of it&mdash;at
last.... Instinct!... Shows there's
something&mdash;awful behind it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>If Richard had been murdering the man, he
could not have had a sharper sense of guilt than at
that moment oppressed him.</p>

<p>Mr. Aked continued to talk, but with a growing
incoherence which gradually passed into delirium.
Richard looked at his watch. Only thirty minutes
had slipped by, and yet he felt as if his shoulder had
suffered the clutch of that hot hand since before the
beginning of time! Again he experienced the disconcerting
sensation of emotional horizons suddenly
widened.</p>

<p>People were walking down the street; they talked
and laughed. How incongruously mirthful and
careless their voices sounded! Perhaps they had
never watched by a sick-bed, never listened to the
agonised breathing of a pneumonia patient. That
incessant frantic intake of air! It exasperated him.
If it did not stop soon, he should go mad. He
stared at the gas-flame, and the gas-flame grew
larger, larger, till he could see nothing else....
Then, after a long while, surely the breathing was
more difficult! There was a reverberating turmoil
in the man's chest which shook the bed. Could
Richard have been asleep, or what? He started up;
but Mr. Aked clung desperately to him, raising his
shoulders higher and higher in the struggle to inhale,
and leaning forward till he was bent almost double.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
Richard hesitated, and then struck the bell. It
seemed as if the nurse would never come.
The door opened softly.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he is much worse," Richard said to
the nurse, striving to cover his agitation. She
looked at Mr. Aked.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you had better fetch the doctor."</p>

<p>When he returned, Mr. Aked was lying back unconscious.</p>

<p>"Of course the doctor can do nothing now," said
the nurse, calmly answering the question in his eyes.
"He'll never speak any more."</p>

<p>"But Miss Aked?"</p>

<p>"It can't be helped. I shall say nothing to her
till morning."</p>

<p>"Then she won't see him?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. It would be madness for her to
leave her bed."</p>

<p>The doctor arrived, and the three talked quietly
together about the alarming prevalence of influenza
at that time of the year, and the fatal results of carelessness.</p>

<p>"I tell you honestly," the doctor said, "I'm so
overworked that I should be quite satisfied to step
into my coffin and not wake again. I've had three
3 A. M. midwifery cases this week&mdash;forceps, chloroform,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
and the whole bag of tricks&mdash;on the top of
all this influenza, and I'm about sick of it. That's
the worst of our trade; it comes in lumps. What do
you say, nurse?"</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XVII</h4>


<p>The nurse suggested that Richard should remain
at Carteret Street for the rest of the
night, using the sofa in the sitting-room.
Contrary to his expectation, he slept well and dreamlessly
for several hours, and woke up refreshed and
energetic. The summer sun was dispersing a light
mist. One thought occupied his mind,&mdash;Adeline's
isolation and need of succour. Mentally he enveloped
her with tender solicitude; and the prospect of
giving her instant aid, and so earning her gratitude,
contributed to a mood of vigorous cheerfulness to
which his sorrow for Mr. Aked's death formed but
a vague and distant background.</p>

<p>No one seemed to be stirring. He washed luxuriously
in the little scullery, and then, silently unbolting
the front door, went out for a walk. It was
just six o'clock, and above the weazen trees which
line either side of Carteret Street the sparrows were
noisily hilarious. As he strode along in the fresh,
sunny air, his fancy pictured scene after scene between
himself and Adeline in which he rendered a
man's help and she offered a woman's gratitude.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
He determined to take upon himself all the arrangements
for the funeral, and looked forward pleasurably
to activities from which under different circumstances
he would have shrunk with dismay. He
thought of Adeline's aunt or cousin, distant in the
north, and wondered whether she or any other relatives,
if such existed, would present themselves; he
hoped that Adeline might be forced to rely solely
on him. A milkboy who passed with his rattling
cans observed Richard talking rapidly to no visible
person, and turned round to stare.</p>

<p>When he got back to the house, he noticed that
the blinds had been drawn in the sitting-room. Lottie,
the chubby-armed servant, was cleaning the step;
her eyes were red with crying.</p>

<p>"Is nurse up yet?" he asked her.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, she's in the kitchen," the girl whimpered.</p>

<p>He sprang over the wet step into the passage.
As his glance fell on the stairs leading up to the
room where lay the body of Mr. Aked, separated
from the unconscious Adeline only by a gimcrack
wall of lath and plaster, an uncomfortable feeling of
awe took hold of him. Death was very incurable,
and he had been assisting at a tragedy. How unreal
and distorted seemed the events of a few hours
before! He had a curious sense of partnership in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
shame, as if he and the nurse and the doctor had
last night done Adeline an injury and were conspiring
to hide their sin. What would she say when
she knew that her uncle was dead? What would be
her plans? It occurred to him now that she would
of course act quite independently of himself; it was
ridiculous to suppose that he, comparatively a
stranger, could stand to her in the place of kith and
kin; he had been dreaming. He was miserably disheartened.</p>

<p>He made his way to the kitchen, and, pushing the
door open quietly, found the nurse engaged in cooking
a meal.</p>

<p>"May I come in, nurse?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Larch."</p>

<p>"You seem to have taken charge of the house,"
he said, admiring her quick, neat movements; she
was as much at home as if the kitchen had been her
own.</p>

<p>"We often find it necessary," she smiled.
"Nurses have to be ready for most things. Do
you prefer tea or coffee for breakfast?"</p>

<p>"Surely you aren't getting breakfast for me? I
could have had something in town."</p>

<p>"Surely I am," she said. "If you aren't fastidious,
I'll make tea. Miss Aked has had a moderately
good night ... I've told her....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
She took it very well, said she expected it. Of
course there's a lot to be done, but I can't bother
her yet. We ought to have a telegram from Mrs.
Hopkins, her aunt, this morning."</p>

<p>"I wish you would give Miss Aked a message
from me," Richard broke in. "Tell her I shall be
very glad to see after things&mdash;the funeral, you
know, and so on&mdash;if she cares. I can easily arrange
to take a holiday from the office."</p>

<p>"I am sure that would relieve her from a lot of
anxiety," the nurse said appreciatively. To hide a
certain confusion Richard suggested that he should
be allowed to lay the cloth in the sitting-room, and
she told him he would find it in a drawer in the
sideboard. He wandered off, speculating upon
Adeline's probable answer to his proposal. Soon he
heard the rattling of cups and saucers, and the
nurse's footstep on the stair. He laid the cloth,
putting the cruet in the middle and the salt-cellars
at opposite corners, and then sat down in front of
the case of French books to scan their titles, but he
saw nothing save a blur of yellow. After a long
time the nurse came down again.</p>

<p>"Miss Aked says she cannot thank you enough.
She will leave everything to you,&mdash;everything.
She is very much obliged indeed. She doesn't think
Mrs. Hopkins will be able to travel, because of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
rheumatism, and there is no one else. Here is the
key of Mr. Aked's desk, and some other keys&mdash;there
should be about £20 in gold in the cash box,
and perhaps some notes."</p>

<p>He took the keys, feeling profoundly happy.</p>

<p>"I shall just go up to the office first," he decided,
"and arrange to get off, and then come down here
again. I suppose you will stay on till Miss Aked
is better?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course."</p>

<p>"She will be in bed several days yet?"</p>

<p>"Probably. She might be able to sit up an hour
or two the day after to-morrow&mdash;in her own room."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't do for me to see her?"</p>

<p>"I think not. She is very weak. No, you must
act on your own responsibility."</p>

<p>He and the nurse had breakfast together, talking
with the freedom of old friends. He told her all
he knew of the Akeds, not forgetting to mention
that Mr. Aked and himself were to have collaborated
in a book. When Richard let this out, she showed
none of those signs of timid reverence which the
laity are wont to exhibit in the presence of literary
people.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" she said politely, and then after a little
pause: "I actually write verses myself sometimes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>"You do? And are they published?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, but perhaps not on their merits. You
see, my father has influence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A journalist, is he, perhaps?"</p>

<p>She laughed at the idea, and mentioned the name
of a well-known novelist.</p>

<p>"And you prefer nursing to writing!" Richard
ejaculated when he had recovered from the announcement.</p>

<p>"To anything in the world. That is why I am
a nurse. Why should I depend on my father, or
my father's reputation?"</p>

<p>"I admire you for not doing so," Richard replied.
Hitherto he had only read about such women, and
had questioned if they really existed. He grew
humble before her, recognising a stronger spirit.
Yet her self-reliance somehow chafed him, and he
directed his thoughts to Adeline's feminine trustfulness
with a slight sense of relief.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The funeral took place on Sunday. Richard
found the formalities to be fewer and simpler than
he had expected, and no difficulties arose of any
kind. Mrs. Hopkins, as Adeline had foreseen, was
unable to come, but she sent a long letter full of advice,
and offering her niece a temporary home.
Adeline had not yet been allowed to leave her bed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
but on the Sunday morning the nurse had said that
she might sit up for an hour or two in the afternoon,
and would like to see Richard then.</p>

<p>He returned to Carteret Street on foot when the
funeral was over.</p>

<p>"You are glad it is all finished?" the nurse said.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered a little wearily. His mind
had dwelt on Mr. Aked that day, and the lonely
futility of the man's life had touched him with chill,
depressing effect. Moreover, now it came to the
point, he rather dreaded than desired that first interview
with Adeline after her uncle's death. He
feared that despite any service he had rendered,
they were not much more than acquaintances. He
morbidly conjectured what she would say to him and
how he would reply. But he was glad when the
nurse left him alone at the door of Adeline's room.
He knocked rather louder than he had intended, and
after hesitating a second walked in. Adeline was
seated in an armchair near the window, fully dressed
in black, with a shawl over her shoulders. Her
back was towards him, but he could see that she was
writing a letter on her knee. She looked round suddenly
as the door opened, and gave a little "Oh!"
at the same time lifting her hands. Her face was
pale, her hair flat, and her eyes large and glittering.
He went up to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Larch!" She held his hand in her thin
white one with a soft, weak pressure, silently gazing
at him while tears gathered in her upturned eyes.
Richard trembled in every part of his body; he could
not speak, and wondered what was the matter with
him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Larch, you have been very kind. I shall
never be able to thank you."</p>

<p>"I hope you won't bother about any thanks," he
said. "Are you better?" And yet he wished her
to say more.</p>

<p>With apparent reluctance she loosed his hand,
and he sat down near her.</p>

<p>"What should I have done without you!...
Tell me about to-day. You can't think how relieved
I am now that it is over&mdash;the funeral, I mean."</p>

<p>He said there was nothing to tell.</p>

<p>"Were there many other funerals?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a lot."</p>

<p>He answered her questions one after another; she
seemed to be interested in the least detail, but
neither of them mentioned the dead man. Her
eyes seldom left him. When he suggested that she
must dismiss him as soon as she felt tired, she
laughed, and replied that she was not likely to be
tired for a very long while, and that he must have
tea with her and nurse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was writing to my two uncles in San Francisco
when you came in," she said. "They will be terribly
upset about me at first, poor fellows, but I have
told them how kind you have been, and Uncle Mark
always used to say I had plenty of sense, so that
ought to ease their minds." She smiled.</p>

<p>"Of course you have made no definite plans yet?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"No, I sha'n't settle anything at present. I want
to consult you about several things, but some other
time, when I am better. I shall have enough money,
I think&mdash;that is one solid comfort. My aunt
Grace&mdash;Mrs. Hopkins&mdash;has asked me to go and
stay with her. Somehow I don't want to go&mdash;you'll
think it queer of me, I daresay, but I would
really prefer to stop in London."</p>

<p>He noticed that she said nothing as to joining her
uncles in San Francisco.</p>

<p>"I fancy I shall like London," she went on, "when
I know it."</p>

<p>"You aren't thinking, then, of going to San Francisco?"</p>

<p>He waited apprehensively for her answer. She
hesitated. "It is so far&mdash;I don't quite know how
my uncles are situated&mdash;"</p>

<p>Evidently, for some reason, she had no desire to
leave London immediately. He was very content,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
having feared that she might pass at once away from
him.</p>

<p>They had tea on a little round chess-table. The
cramped space and the consequent necessity of putting
spare plates of cake on the bed caused some amusement,
but in the presence of the strong, brusque nurse
Adeline seemed to withdraw within herself, and the
conversation, such as it was, depended on the other
two.</p>

<p>"I have been telling Miss Aked," the nurse said
after tea was over, "that she must go to the seaside
for a week or two. It will do her an immense deal
of good. What she needs most of all is change. I
suggested Littlehampton; it is rather a quiet spot,
not too quiet; there is nice river scenery, and a quaint
old port, and quantities of lovely rustic villages in
the neighbourhood."</p>

<p>"It would certainly be a good thing," Richard
agreed; but Adeline said, rather petulantly, that she
did not wish to travel, and the project was not discussed
further.</p>

<p>He left soon afterwards. The walk home seemed
surprisingly short, and when he got to Raphael
Street he could remember nothing of the thoroughfares
through which he had passed. Vague, delicious
fancies flitted through his head, like fine lines
half recalled from a great poem. In his room there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
was a smell from the lamp, and the windows were
shut tight.</p>

<p>"Poor old landlady," he murmured benignantly,
"when will she learn to leave the windows open and
not to turn down the lamp?"</p>

<p>Having unfastened one of the windows, he extinguished
the lamp and went out on to the little
balcony. It was a warm evening, with a cloudy sky
and a gentle, tepid breeze. The noise of omnibuses
and cabs came even and regular from Brompton
Road, and occasionally a hansom passed up Raphael
Street. He stood leaning on the front of the balcony
till the air of traffic had declined to an infrequent
rumble, his thoughts a smiling, whirling
medley impossible to analyze or describe. At last
he came in, and, leaving the window ajar, undressed
slowly without a light, and lay down. He had no
desire to sleep, nor did he attempt to do so; not for
a ransom would he have parted with the fine, full
consciousness of life which thrilled through every
portion of his being. The brief summer night came
to an end; and just as the sun was rising he dozed a
little, and then got up without a trace of fatigue.
He went to the balcony again, and drank in all the
sweet invigorating freshness of the morning. The
sunlit streets were enveloped in an enchanted silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>




<h4>CHAPTER XVIII</h4>


<p>Nearly three weeks later came the following
letter from Adeline. In the meanwhile
she had had a rather serious relapse,
and he had seen her only once or twice for a few
minutes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>My dear Mr. Larch,&mdash;This time I am <i>quite</i> sure I
am well again. Nurse is obliged to leave to-day, as she is
wanted at a hospital, and she has persuaded me to go to
Littlehampton <i>at once</i>, and given me the address of some
rooms. I shall leave Victoria to-morrow (Wednesday) by
the 1.10 train; Lottie will go with me, and the house will
be locked up. Good-bye for the present, if I don't see you.
We shall not stay more than a week or ten days. I will
write to you from Littlehampton.</p>

<p>Ever yours most gratefully,</p>

<p>A. A.</p>

<p>P. S. I was expecting you down to-night.</p></blockquote>

<p>"'If I don't see you'!" he repeated to himself,
smiling, and examining Adeline's caligraphy, which
he had not seen before. It was a bold but not distinguished
hand. He read the note several times,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
then folded it carefully and put it in his pocket-book.</p>

<p>By reason of an unexpected delay at the office he
almost missed her at Victoria. The train was due
out at least a minute before he rushed into the station;
fortunately trains are not invariably prompt.
Adeline was leaning from a carriage window to hand
a penny to a newspaper boy; the boy dropped the
penny, and she laughed. She wore a black hat with
a veil. Her cheeks were a little fuller, and her eyes
less unnaturally brilliant, at any rate under the veil;
and Richard thought that he had never seen her
look so pretty.</p>

<p>"There it is, silly boy, there!" she was saying as
he came up.</p>

<p>"I thought I'd just see if you were all right," he
panted. "I should have been here earlier, only I
was detained."</p>

<p>"How kind of you to take so much trouble!" she
said, taking his hand, and fixing her eyes intently on
his. The guard came along to fasten the doors.</p>

<p>"Luggage all in?" Richard asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, thanks. Lottie saw to it while I got the
tickets. I find she is quite an experienced traveller."
At which Lottie, effaced in a corner, blushed.</p>

<p>"Well, I hope you will enjoy yourself." The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
whistle sounded, and the train jerked forward
Adeline began to wave a good-bye.</p>

<p>"I see there's a Sunday league trip to Littlehampton
on Sunday," he said, walking along with
the train.</p>

<p>"Oh! Do come down."</p>

<p>"You'd like me to?"</p>

<p>"Very much."</p>

<p>"I will, then. Send me the address."</p>

<p>She gave a succession of little nods, as the train
carried her away.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>




<h4>CHAPTER XIX</h4>


<p>Richard's eye travelled expectantly over
the tanned crowd of men in flannels and
gaily attired girls which lined the platform
of Littlehampton station, but Adeline was not to be
seen. He felt somewhat disappointed, and then decided
that he liked her the better for not having
come to meet him. "Besides," he thought, "the
train being a special is not in the time-table, and she
would not know when it was due."</p>

<p>Her lodging was in a long, monotonous terrace
which ran at right angles to the seashore, turning
its back upon the river. Noon was at hand, and the
fierce rays of the unclouded sun were untempered
by any breeze. The street lay hushed, for everyone
was either at church or on the sands. In response
to his inquiry, the landlady said that Miss
Aked was out, and had left a message that if a
gentleman called, he was to follow her to the jetty.
Obeying the directions given to him, Richard soon
found himself by the banks of the swift Arun, with
the jetty some distance in front, and beyond that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
sea, which shimmered blindly in the heat. Throngs
of respectably dressed people wandered up and down,
and a low, languid murmur of conversation floated
out as it were from the cavities of a thousand
parasols. Perspiring children whose hands were
chafed by gloves full of creases ran to and fro among
the groups, shouting noisily, and heedless of the
frequent injunction to remember what day it was.
Here and there nurses pushing perambulators made
cool spots of whiteness in the confusion of colour.
On the river boats and small yachts were continually
sweeping towards the sea on the ebbing tide;
now and then a crew of boys would attempt to pull
a skiff against the rapid current, persevere for a few
strokes, and then, amid scoffs from the bank, ignominiously
allow themselves to be whirled past the jetty
with the other craft.</p>

<p>Richard had never seen a southern watering-place
before, and he had fondly expected something
different from Llandudno, Rhyl, or Blackpool,
something less stolid and more continental. Littlehampton
fell short of his anticipations. It was unpicturesque
as a manufacturing town, and its summer
visitors were an infestive, lower-middle class
folk, garishly clothed, and unlearned in the fine art
of enjoyment. The pure accent of London sounded
on every side from the lips of clerks and shop-girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
and their kin. Richard forgot that he was himself
a clerk, looking not out of place in that scene.</p>

<p>Presently he espied a woman who seemed to belong
to another sphere. She was leaning over the
parapet of the jetty, and though a black and white
sunshade entirely hid her head and shoulders, the
simple, perfectly hung black skirt, the neatly shod
foot, the small, smoothly gloved hand with thin gold
circlet at wrist, sufficed to convince him that here,
by some strange chance, was one of those exquisite
creatures who on Saturday afternoons drove
past the end of Raphael Street on their way to Hurlingham
or Barnes. He wondered what she did
there, and tried to determine the subtleties of demeanour
and costume which constituted the plain difference
between herself and the other girls on the
jetty. At that moment she stood erect, and turned
round. Why, she was quite young.... He
approached her.... It was Adeline.</p>

<p>Astonishment was so clearly written on his face
that she laughed as they exchanged greetings.</p>

<p>"You seem startled at the change in me," she said
abruptly. "Do you know that I positively adore
clothes, though I've only just found it out. The
first thing I did when I got here was to go over to
Brighton, and spend terrific sums at a dressmaker's.
You see, there wasn't time in London. You don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
despise me for it, I hope? I've plenty of money&mdash;enough
to last a long, long time."</p>

<p>She was dazzling, and she openly rejoiced in the
effect her appearance had made on Richard.</p>

<p>"You couldn't have done better," he answered,
suddenly discovering with chagrin that his own serge
suit was worn and shabby.</p>

<p>"I'm relieved," she said; "I was afraid my
friend might think me vain and extravagant." Her
manner of saying "my friend"&mdash;half mockery, half
deference&mdash;gave Richard intense satisfaction.</p>

<p>They walked to the end of the jetty and sat down
on a stone seat.</p>

<p>"Isn't it beautiful?" she exclaimed enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;the town, or the people, or the sea?"</p>

<p>"Everything. I've scarcely been to the seaside
before in all my life, and I think it's lovely."</p>

<p>"The sea would be splendid if one could see it,
but it blinds one even to glance at it in this heat."</p>

<p>"You shall have half my sunshade." She put
it over him with a protective gesture.</p>

<p>"No, no," he demurred.</p>

<p>"I say yes. Why don't men carry sunshades?
It's only their pride that stops them.... So
you don't like the town and the people?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>"I love to see plenty of people about. And you
would, too, if you'd been fixed like me. I've never
seen a real crowd. There are crushes when you go
into theatres, sometimes, aren't there?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Women faint."</p>

<p>"But I shouldn't. I would have given anything
not long ago to be in one of those crushes. Now, of
course, I can just please myself. When we are back
in London, do you think I could persuade you to
take me?"</p>

<p>"You might," he said, "if you asked nicely. But
young ladies who wear clothes like yours don't
usually patronise the pit, where the crushes are.
Stalls or dress circle would be more in your style. I
propose we take the dress circle. You wouldn't enjoy
your crush going in, but at the Lyceum and some
other theatres, there is quite a superior crush coming
out of the stalls and dress circle."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is better. And I shall buy more
clothes. Oh! I will be shockingly wasteful. If
poor old uncle knew how his money was to be
spent&mdash;"</p>

<p>A little child, chased by one still less, fell down
flat in front of them, and began to cry. Adeline
picked it up, losing her sunshade, and kissed both
children. Then she took a paper of chocolates from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
her pocket and gave several to each child, and they
ran away without saying thank you.</p>

<p>"Have one?" She offered the bag to Richard.
"That's another luxury I shall indulge in&mdash;chocolates.
Do have just one, to keep me company," she
appealed. "By the way, about dinner. I ordered
dinner for both of us at my rooms, but we can improve
on that. I have discovered a lovely little village
a few miles away, Angmering, all old cottages
and no drains. Let us drive there in a victoria, and
picnic at a cottage. I know the exact place for us.
There will be no people there to annoy you."</p>

<p>"But you like 'people,' so that won't do at all."</p>

<p>"I will do without 'people' for this day."</p>

<p>"And what shall we have for dinner?"</p>

<p>"Oh! Eggs and bread and butter and tea."</p>

<p>"Tea for dinner! Not very solid, is it?"</p>

<p>"Greedy! If you have such a large appetite, eat
a few more chocolates; they will take it away."</p>

<p>She rose, pointing to a victoria in the distance.</p>

<p>He looked at her without getting up, and their
eyes met with smiles. Then he, too, rose. He
thought he had never felt so happy. An intoxicating
vision of future felicities momentarily suggested
itself, only to fade before the actuality of the present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>The victoria stopped at Adeline's rooms. She
called through the open window to Lottie, who came
out and received orders to dine alone, or with the
landlady if she preferred.</p>

<p>"Lottie and Mrs. Bishop are great friends," Adeline
said. "The silly girl would sooner stay in to
help Mrs. Bishop with housework than go out on
the beach with me."</p>

<p>"She must indeed be silly. I know which I
should choose!" It seemed a remark of unutterable
clumsiness&mdash;after he had said it, but Adeline's
faint smile showed no dissatisfaction. He reflected
that he would have been better pleased had she totally
ignored it.</p>

<p>The carriage ran smoothly along the dusty roads,
now passing under trees, and now skirting poppy-clad
fields whose vivid scarlet almost encroached on the
highway itself. Richard lay back, as he had seen
men do in the Park, his shoulder lightly touching
Adeline's. She talked incessantly, though slowly, in
that low voice of hers, and her tones mingled with
the measured trot of the enfeebled horse, and lulled
Richard to a sensuous quiescence. He slightly
turned his face towards hers, and with dreamy deliberateness
examined her features,&mdash;the dimple in
her cheek which he had never noticed before, the
curves of her ear, her teeth, her smooth black hair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
the play of light in her eye; then his gaze moved
to her large felt hat, set bewitchingly aslant on the
small head, and then for a space he would look at the
yellowish-green back of the imperturbable driver,
who drove on and on, little witting that enchantment
was behind him.</p>

<p>They consumed the eggs and bread and butter and
tea which Adeline had promised; and they filled their
pockets with fruit. That was Adeline's idea. She
gave herself up to enjoyment like a child. When
the sun was less strenuous they walked about the village,
sitting down frequently to admire its continual
picturesqueness. Time sped with astonishing rapidity;
Richard's train went at twenty-five minutes past
seven, and already, as they stood by the margin of
the tiny tributary of the Arun, some grandfather's
clock in a neighbouring cottage clattered five. He
was tempted to say nothing about the train, quietly
allow himself to miss it, and go up by the first
ordinary on Monday morning. But soon Adeline
inquired about his return, and they set off to walk
back to Littlehampton; the carriage had been dismissed.
He invented pretexts for loitering, made
her sit on walls to eat apples, tried to get lost in by-paths,
protested that he could not keep the pace she
set; but to no purpose. They arrived at the station
at exactly a quarter past seven. The platform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
was busy, and they strolled to the far end of it and
stood by the engine.</p>

<p>"I wish to heaven the train didn't leave so early,"
he said. "I'm sure the sea air would do me a lot
of good, if I could get enough of it. What a beautiful
day it has been!" He sighed sentimentally.</p>

<p>"I never, never enjoyed myself so perfectly," she
said emphatically. "Suppose we beseech the engine-driver
to lie still for a couple of hours?" Richard's
smile was inattentive.</p>

<p>"You are sure you haven't done too much," he
said with sudden solicitude, looking at her half anxiously.</p>

<p>"I! not a bit. I am absolutely well again." Her
eyes found his and held them, and it seemed to him
that mystic messages passed to and fro.</p>

<p>"How long do you think of staying?"</p>

<p>"Not long. It gets rather boring, being alone.
I expect I shall return on Saturday."</p>

<p>"I was thinking I would run down again on Saturday
for the week-end,&mdash;take a week-end ticket,"
he said; "but of course, if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In that case I should stay a few days longer. I
couldn't allow myself to deprive you of the sea air
which is doing you so much good. By next Saturday
I may have discovered more nice places to visit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
perhaps even prettier than Angmering....
But you must get in."</p>

<p>He would have given a great deal just then to be
able to say firmly: "I have changed my mind about
going. I will stay at a hotel to-night and take the
first train to-morrow." But it required more decision
than he possessed, and in a few moments he
was waving good-bye to her from the carriage window.</p>

<p>There were several other people in the compartment,&mdash;a
shy shop-girl and her middle-aged lover,
evidently employés of the same establishment, and an
artisan with his wife and a young child. Richard
observed them intently, and found a curious, new
pleasure in all their unstudied gestures and in everything
they said. But chiefly he kept a watch on the
shop-girl's lover, who made it no secret that he was
dwelling in the seventh heaven. Richard sympathised
with that man. His glance fell on him
softly, benignantly. As the train passed station after
station, he wondered what Adeline was doing, now,
and now, and now.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the following Saturday he took tea with Adeline
at her lodgings. The train had been late, and
by the time they were ready for the evening walk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
without which no visitor to the seaside calls the day
complete, it was close upon nine o'clock. The beach
was like a fair or a north-country wake. Conjurers,
fire-eaters, and minstrels each drew an audience; but
the principal attraction was a man and woman who
wore masks and were commonly supposed to be distinguished
persons to whom fate had been unkind.
They had a piano in a donkey-cart, and the woman
sang to the man's accompaniment. Just as Richard
and Adeline came up, "The River of Years" was
announced for performance.</p>

<p>"Let us listen to this," said Adeline.</p>

<p>They stood at the rim of the crowd. The woman
had a rich contralto voice and sang with feeling,
and her listeners were generous of both applause and
coppers.</p>

<p>"I wonder who she is," Adeline murmured, with
a touch of melancholy,&mdash;"I wonder who she is. I
love that song."</p>

<p>"Oh, probably some broken-down concert-singer,"
Richard said curtly, "with a drunken husband."</p>

<p>"But she sang beautifully. She made me feel&mdash;you
know&mdash;funny.... A lovely feeling,
isn't it?" She looked up at him.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, smiling at her.</p>

<p>"You're laughing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed I'm not. I know what you mean perfectly
well. Perhaps I had it just then, too&mdash;- a
little. But the song is a bit cheap."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> could listen to it every day, and never get tired
of listening. Don't you think that if a song gives
<i>anyone</i> that&mdash;feeling, there must be some good in
it?"</p>

<p>"Of course it's far better than most; but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But not equal to those classical songs you told
me about&mdash;the first time I saw you, wasn't it?
Yes, Schubert: was that the name? I mean to get
those, and you must show me the best ones, and play
the accompaniments, and then I shall judge for myself."</p>

<p>"I shall make an awful mess of the accompaniments;
they're not precisely easy, you know."</p>

<p>"Full of accidentals, are they? I sha'n't like
them, then. I never do like that sort of song."</p>

<p>"But you will; you must."</p>

<p>"Must I?" she almost whispered, in tones of
gentle, feminine surrender. And after a second or
two: "Then I'll try, if it will keep you in a good
temper."</p>

<p>They stood fronting the sea. She looked straight
ahead into the darkening distance, and then turned
round to him with a mock plaintive expression, and
they both laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be better up by the river," he suggested,
"where there are fewer people?"</p>

<p>A little to his surprise, she agreed that it was
certainly rather noisy and crowded on the beach on
Saturday nights, and they turned their backs to the
shore. The moon had risen, and shone at intervals
through clouds. For a few score yards they walked
in silence. Then Adeline said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's very dull here during the week for a poor
single woman like me. I shall go home on Monday."</p>

<p>"But think of London in this weather."</p>

<p>"I do think of it. I think of the parks and
the restaurants and the theatres."</p>

<p>"The good theatres are closed now."</p>

<p>"Well, the music-halls. I've never been in one,
and if they are very naughty, then I want to go very
much. Besides, there are lots of theatres open.
I've read all the theatrical advertisements in the
'Telegraph,' and there must be plenty of things to
see. You mayn't think them worth seeing, but I
should enjoy any theatre."</p>

<p>"I believe you would," he said. "I used to be
like that."</p>

<p>"Up to now I've had no real pleasure&mdash;what I
call pleasure&mdash;and I'm just going to have it. I'll
settle down afterwards."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>"Didn't your uncle take you out much?"</p>

<p>"I should say he didn't. He took me to a concert
once. That was all&mdash;in nearly two years. I
suppose it never occurred to him that I was leading
a dull life."</p>

<p>She made a movement with her hands, as if to put
away from her all the drab dailiness of her existence
in Carteret Street.</p>

<p>"You can soon recover lost time," Richard said
cheerfully.</p>

<p>His fancy was in the rosy future, vividly picturing
the light-hearted gaieties, Bohemian, unconventional,
artistic, in which he and she should unite. He saw
himself and Adeline becoming dearer to each other,
and still dearer, her spirit unfolding like a flower,
and disclosing new beauties day by day. He saw
her eyes glisten when they met his; felt the soft
pressure of her hand; heard her voice waver with
tenderness, expectant of his avowal. And then came
his own bold declaration: "I love you, Adeline,"
and her warm, willing lips were upon his. God!
To dream of such beatitudes!</p>

<p>She had slightly quickened her step. The quays
were silent and deserted, save for these two. Presently
masts rose vaguely against the sky, and they approached
a large ship. Richard leaned over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
parapet to decipher the name on her bows.
"Juliane," he spelt out.</p>

<p>"That is Norwegian or Danish."</p>

<p>They lingered a few moments, watching the
movements of dim figures on deck, listening to the
musical chatter of an unknown tongue, and breathing
that atmosphere of romance and adventure which
foreign vessels carry with them from strange lands;
then they walked on.</p>

<p>"Hush!" exclaimed Adeline, stopping, and touching
Richard's arm.</p>

<p>The sailors were singing some quaint modern
strain.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked when they had finished
a verse.</p>

<p>"It must be a Norwegian folk-song. It reminds
me of Grieg."</p>

<p>Another verse was sung. It began to rain,&mdash;warm,
summer drops.</p>

<p>"You will be wet," Richard said.</p>

<p>"Never mind."</p>

<p>A third verse followed, and then a new air was
started. It rained faster.</p>

<p>"Come under the shelter of the wall here," Richard
urged, timidly taking her arm. "I think I see
an archway."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," she murmured, with sweet acquiescence;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
and they stood together a long time under
the archway in silence, while the Norwegian sailors,
heedless of weather, sang song after song.</p>

<p>The next morning the sky had cleared again, but
there was a mist over the calm sea. They walked
idly on the level sands. At first they were almost
alone. The mist intensified distances; a group of
little children paddling in a foot of water appeared
to be miles away. Slowly the mist was scattered by
the sun, and the beach became populous with visitors
in Sunday attire. In the afternoon they drove to
Angmering, Adeline having found no preferable
haunt.</p>

<p>"You have no train to catch to-night," she said;
"what a relief! Shall you start very early to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"I'm not particular," he answered. "Why?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking that Lottie and I would go up
by the same train as you, but perhaps you won't care
to be bothered with women and their luggage."</p>

<p>"If you really intend to return to-morrow, I'll
wire to Curpet not to expect me till after lunch, and
we'll go at a reasonable hour."</p>

<p>He left her at her lodging as the clock was striking
eleven; but instead of making direct for his
hotel, he turned aside to the river to have a last look
at the "Juliane." Curiously, it began to rain, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
he sheltered under the archway where he had stood
with Adeline on the previous night. Aboard the
"Juliane" there was stir and bustle. He guessed
that the ship was about to weigh anchor and drop
down with the tide. Just after midnight she slid
cautiously away from the quay, to the accompaniment
of hoarse calls and the rattling of chains and
blocks.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>




<h4>CHAPTER XX</h4>


<p>During the journey to town Adeline
would talk of nothing but her intention to
taste all the amusements which London
had to offer. She asked numberless questions with
the persistency of an inquisitive child, while Lottie
modestly hid herself behind a copy of "Tit Bits,"
which had been bought for her.</p>

<p>"Now I will read out the names of the plays advertised
in the 'Telegraph,'" she said, "and you
must tell me what each is like, and whether the actors
are good, and the actresses pretty, and things of
that kind."</p>

<p>Richard entered with zest into the conversation.
He was in a boisterous mood, and found her very
willing to be diverted. Once, when he used a technical
term, she stopped him: "Remember, I have
never been to a theatre." On Sunday she had made
the same remark several times. It seemed as if she
liked to insist on the point.</p>

<p>The morning was delicious, full of light and freshness,
and the torpid countryside through which the
train swept at full speed suggested a gentle yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
piquant contrast to the urban, gaslight themes which
they were discussing. Though the sun shone with
power, Adeline would not have the blinds drawn, but
sometimes she used the newspaper for a shade, or
bent her head so that the broad brim of her hat
might come between her eyes and the sunshine.
After an hour the talk slackened somewhat. As
Richard, from his seat opposite, looked now at
Adeline and now at the landscape, a perfect content
stole over him. He wished that the distance to
London could have been multiplied tenfold, and rejoiced
in every delay. Then he began to miss the
purport of her questions, and she had to repeat
them. He was examining his heart. "Is this
love?" his thoughts ran. "Do I actually love her
now,&mdash;<i>now</i>?"</p>

<p>When the train stopped at New Cross, and Richard
said that they would be at London Bridge in a
few minutes, she asked when he would go down to
Carteret Street.</p>

<p>"Any time," he said.</p>

<p>"To-morrow night?"</p>

<p>He had hoped she would fix the same evening.
"When is the theatre-going to commence?" he
queried.</p>

<p>She laughed vaguely: "Soon."</p>

<p>"Suppose I book seats for the Comedy?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>"We will talk about it to-morrow night."</p>

<p>It appeared that her desire for the relaxations of
town life had suddenly lost its instancy.</p>

<p>Immediately he reached the office he wrote a note
to Mr. Clayton Vernon. Some three hundred
pounds was coming to him under the will of William
Vernon, and he had purposed to let Mr. Clayton
Vernon invest this sum for him; but the letter asked
that a cheque for £25 should be sent by return of
post. Later in the afternoon he went to a tailor in
Holborn, and ordered two suits of clothes.</p>

<p>He grew restless and introspective, vainly endeavouring
to analyse his feeling towards Adeline.
He wished that he had himself suggested that he
should call on her that night, instead of allowing her
to name Tuesday. When he got home, he looked
at the letter which he had received from her a fortnight
before, and then, enclosing it in a clean envelope,
put it away carefully in his writing-case. He
felt that he must preserve all her letters. The evening
dragged itself out with desolating tedium. Once
he went downstairs intending to go to the theatre,
but returned before he had unlatched the front door.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowbotham laid his supper that evening,
and he began to tell her about his holiday, mentioning,
with fictitious <i>naïveté</i>, that he had spent it in the
company of a young lady. Soon he gave the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
history of his acquaintance with the Akeds. She
warmly praised his kindness towards Adeline.</p>

<p>"My Lily is keeping company with a young man,"
she said, after a pause; "a respectable young chap
he is, a bus-conductor. This is his night off, and
they're gone to the Promenade Concert. I didn't
like her going at first, but, bless you, you have to
give in. Young folk are young folk, all the world
over.... But I must be getting downstairs
again. I have to do everything myself to-night.
Ah! when a girl falls in love, she forgets her mother.
It's natural, I suppose. Well, Mr. Larch, it will
be your turn soon, I hope." With that she left the
room quickly, missing Richard's hurried disclaimer.</p>

<p>"So you're engaged, Lily," he said to the girl
next morning.</p>

<p>Lily blushed and nodded; and as he looked at her
eyes, he poignantly longed for the evening.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>




<h4>CHAPTER XXI</h4>

<p>They sat by the window and talked till the
day began to fade and the lamplighter had
passed up the street. Several matters of
business needed discussion,&mdash;the proving of Mr.
Aked's will, the tenancy of the house and the opening
of a new banking-account. Richard, who was
acting informally as legal adviser, after the manner
of solicitors' clerks towards their friends, brought
from his pocket some papers for Adeline's signature.
She took a pen immediately.</p>

<p>"Where do I put my name?"</p>

<p>"But you must read them first."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't understand them a bit," she said;
"and what is the use of employing a lawyer, if one
is put to the trouble of reading everything one
signs?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;please yourself. To-morrow you will
have to go before a commissioner for oaths and
swear that certain things are true; you'll be compelled
to read the affidavits."</p>

<p>"That I won't! I shall just swear."</p>

<p>"But you simply must."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sha'n't. If I swear to fibs, it will be your
fault."</p>

<p>"Suppose I read them out to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that would be nicer; but not now, after supper."</p>

<p>For a few moments there was silence. She stood
up and drew her finger in fanciful curves across the
window-pane. Richard watched her, with a smile
of luxurious content. It appeared to him that all
her movements, every inflection of her voice, her
least word, had the authenticity and the intrinsic
grace of natural phenomena. If she turned her
head or tapped her foot, the gesture was right,&mdash;having
the propriety which springs from absolute
self-unconsciousness. Her mere existence from one
moment to the next seemed in some mysterious way
to suggest a possible solution of the riddle of life.
She illustrated nature. She was for him intimately
a part of nature, the great Nature which hides itself
from cities. To look at her afforded him a delight
curiously similar to that which the townsman derives
from a rural landscape. Her face had little conventional
beauty; her conversation contained no hint
either of intellectual powers or of a capacity for deep
feeling. But in her case, according to his view,
these things were unnecessary, would in fact have
been superfluous. She <i>was</i> and that sufficed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>Mingled with the pleasure which her nearness
gave him, there were subordinate but distinct sensations.
Except his sister Mary, he had never before
been upon terms of close familiarity with any
woman, and he realised with elation that now for
the first time the latencies of manhood were aroused.
His friendship&mdash;if indeed it were nothing else&mdash;with
this gracious, inscrutable creature seemed a
thing to be very proud of, to gloat upon in secret, to
contemplate with a dark smile as one walked along
the street or sat in a bus.... And then, with
a shock of joyful, half-incredulous surprise, he made
the discovery that she&mdash;she&mdash;had found some attractiveness
in himself.</p>

<p>Their loneliness gave zest and piquancy to the
situation. On neither side were there relatives or
friends who might obtrude, or whom it would be
proper to consult. They had only themselves to
consider. Not a soul in London, with the exception
of Lottie, knew of their intimacy,&mdash;the visit to Littlehampton,
their plans for visiting the theatres, her
touching reliance upon him. Ah, that confiding
feminine trust! He read it frequently in her glance,
and it gave him a sense of protective possession.
He had approached no closer than to shake her
hand, and yet, as he looked at the slight frame, the
fragile fingers, the tufts of hair which escaped over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
her ears,&mdash;these things seemed to be his. Surely
she had donned that beautiful dress for him; surely
she moved gracefully for him, talked softly for
him!</p>

<p>He left his chair, quietly lighted the candles at
the piano, and began to turn over some songs.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" she asked, from the window.</p>

<p>"I want you to sing."</p>

<p>"Must I?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Let me find something with an
easy accompaniment."</p>

<p>She came towards him, took up a song, opened it,
and bade him look at it.</p>

<p>"Too difficult," he said abruptly. "Those arpeggios
in the bass,&mdash;I couldn't possibly play
them."</p>

<p>She laid it aside obediently.</p>

<p>"Well, this?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Let us try that."</p>

<p>She moved nearer to him, to miss the reflection of
the candles on the paper, and put her hands behind
her back. She cleared her throat. He knew she
was nervous, but he had no such feeling himself.</p>

<p>"Ready?" he asked, glancing round and up into
her face. She smiled timidly, flushing, and then
nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," she exclaimed the next second, as he boldly
struck the first chord. "I don't think I'll sing. I
can't."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you will&mdash;yes, you will."</p>

<p>"Very well." She resigned herself.</p>

<p>The first few notes were tremulous, but quickly
she gained courage. The song was a mediocre
drawing-room ballad, and she did not sing with much
expression, but to Richard's ear her weak contralto
floated out above the accompaniment with a rich,
passionate quality full of intimate meanings. When
his own part of the performance was not too exacting,
he watched from the corner of his eye the rise
and fall of her breast, and thought of Keats's sonnet;
and then he suddenly quaked in fear that all
this happiness might crumble at the touch of some
adverse fate.</p>

<p>"I suppose you call that a poor song," she said
when it was finished.</p>

<p>"I liked it very much."</p>

<p>"You did? I am so fond of it, and I'm glad you
like it. Shall we try another?" She offered the
suggestion with a gentle diffidence which made
Richard desire to abase himself before her, to ask
what in the name of heaven she meant by looking
to him as an authority, a person whose will was to
be consulted and whose humours were law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>Again she put her hands behind her back, cleared
her throat, and began to sing.... He had
glimpses of mystic, emotional deeps in her spirit
hitherto unsuspected.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lottie came in with a lamp.</p>

<p>"You would like supper?" Adeline said. "Lottie,
let us have supper at once."</p>

<p>Richard remembered that when Mr. Aked was
alive, Adeline had been accustomed to go into the
kitchen and attend to the meals herself; but evidently
this arrangement was now altered. She extinguished
the candles on the piano, and took the
easy-chair with a question about Schubert. Supper
was to be served without the aid of the mistress of
the house. She had been training Lottie,&mdash;that
was clear. He looked round. The furniture was
unchanged, but everything had an unwonted air of
comfort and neatness, and Adeline's beautiful dress
scarcely seemed out of keeping with the general aspect
of the room. He gathered that she had social
aspirations. He had social aspirations himself.
His fancy delighted to busy itself with fine clothes,
fine furniture, fine food, and fine manners. That
his own manners had remained inelegant was due to
the fact that the tireless effort and vigilance which
any amelioration of their original crudity would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
have necessitated, were beyond his tenacity of purpose.</p>

<p>The supper was trimly laid on a very white tablecloth,
and chairs were drawn up. Lottie stood in
the background for a few moments; Adeline called
her for some trifling service, and then dismissed her.</p>

<p>"Won't you have some whisky? I know men always
like whisky at night."</p>

<p>She touched a bell on the table.</p>

<p>"The whisky, Lottie&mdash;you forgot it."</p>

<p>Richard was almost awed by her demeanour.
Where could she have learnt it? He felt not unlike
a bumpkin, and secretly determined to live up to
the standard of deportment which she had set.</p>

<p>"You may smoke," she said, when Lottie had
cleared the table after supper; "I like it. Here are
some cigarettes&mdash;'Three Castles'&mdash;will they do?"
Laughing, she produced a box from the sideboard,
and handed it to him. He went to the sofa, and
she stood with one elbow resting on the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"About going to the theatre&mdash;" she began.</p>

<p>"May I take you? Let us go to the Comedy."</p>

<p>"And you will book seats, the dress circle?"</p>

<p>"Yes. What night?"</p>

<p>"Let us say Friday.... And now you
may read me those documents."</p>

<p>When that business was transacted, Richard felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
somehow that he must depart, and began to take his
leave. Adeline stood erect, facing him in front of
the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"Next time you come, you will bring those Schubert
songs, will you not?"</p>

<p>Then she rang the bell, shook hands, and sat
down. He went out; Lottie was waiting in the
passage with his hat and stick.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>




<h4>CHAPTER XXII</h4>


<p>Seven or eight weeks passed.</p>

<p>During that time Richard spent many
evenings with Adeline, at the theatre, at concerts,
and at Carteret Street. When they were going
up to town, he called for her in a hansom. She
usually kept him waiting a few minutes. He sat in
the sitting-room, listening to the rattle of harness
and the occasional stamp of a hoof outside. At
length he heard her light step on the stairs, and she
entered the room, smiling proudly. She was wonderfully
well dressed, with modish simplicity and
exact finish, and she gave him her fan to hold while
she buttoned her long gloves. Where she ordered
her gowns he never had the least notion. They followed
one another in rapid succession, and each
seemed more beautiful than the last. All were sober
in tint; the bodices were V-shaped, and cut
rather low.</p>

<p>Lottie carefully placed a white wrap over her
mistress's head, and then they were off. In the
hansom there was but little conversation, and that of
a trivial character. In vain he endeavoured to entice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
her into discussions. He mentioned books
which he had read; she showed only a perfunctory
interest. He explained why, in his opinion, a particular
play was good and another bad; generally
she preferred the wrong one, or at least maintained
that she liked all plays, and therefore would not
draw comparisons. Sometimes she would argue
briefly about the conduct of certain characters in a
piece, but he seldom found himself genuinely in
agreement with her, though as a rule he verbally
concurred. In music she was a little less unsympathetic
towards his ideals. They had tried over several
of his favourite classical songs, and he had seen
in her face, as she listened, or hummed the air, a
glow answering to his own enthusiasm. She had said
that she would learn one of them, but the promise
had not been kept, though he had reminded her of
it several times.</p>

<p>These chagrins, however, were but infinitesimal
ripples upon the smooth surface of his happiness.
All of them together were as nothing compared to
the sensations which he experienced in helping her
out of the cab, in the full glare of a theatre façade.
Invariably he overpaid the driver, handing him the
silver with an inattentive gesture, while Adeline
waited on the steps,&mdash;dainty food for the eyes of
loiterers and passers-by. He offered his arm, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
they passed down the vestibule and into the auditorium.
With what artless enjoyment she settled
herself in her seat, breathing the atmosphere of luxury
and display as if it had been ozone, smiling radiantly
at Richard, and then eagerly examining the
occupants of the boxes through a small, silver-mounted
glass! She was never moved by the
events on the stage, and whether it happened to be
tragedy or burlesque at which they were assisting,
she turned to Richard at the end of every act with
the same happy, contented smile, and usually began
to make remarks upon the men and women around
her. It was the play-house and not the play of
which she was really fond.</p>

<p>After the fall of the curtain, they lingered till
most of the audience had gone. Sometimes they
supped at a restaurant. "It is my turn," she would
say now and then, when the obsequious waiter presented
the bill, and would give Richard her purse.
At first, for form's sake, he insisted on his right to
pay, but she would not listen. He wondered where
she had caught the pretty trick of handing over her
purse instead of putting down the coins, and he
traced it to a play which they had seen at the Vaudeville
theatre. Yet she did it with such naturalness
that it did not seem to have been copied. The
purse was small, and always contained several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
pounds in gold, with a little silver. The bill paid,
he gave it back to her with a bow.</p>

<p>Then came the long, rapid drive home, through
interminable lamp-lined streets, peopled now only
by hansoms and private carriages, past all the insolent
and garish splendours of Piccadilly clubs, into
whose unveiled windows Adeline eagerly gazed;
past the mysterious, night-ridden Park; past the dim,
solemn squares and crescents of Kensington and
Chelsea, and so into the meaner vicinage of Fulham.
It was during these midnight journeys, more than at
any other time, that Richard felt himself to be a
veritable inhabitant of the City of Pleasure. Adeline,
flushed with the evening's enjoyment, talked of
many things, in her low, even voice, which was never
raised. Richard answered briefly; an occasional reply
was all she seemed to expect.</p>

<p>Immediately, on getting out of the cab, she said
good-night, and entered the house alone, while
Richard directed the driver back to Raphael Street.
Returning thus, solitary, he endeavoured to define
what she was to him, and he to her. Often, when
actually in her presence, he ventured to ask himself,
"Am I happy? Is this pleasure?" But as soon
as he had left her, his doubtfulness vanished, and he
began to long for their next meeting. Little phrases
of hers, unimportant gestures, came back vividly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
his memory; he thought how instinct with charm
they were. And yet, was he really, truly in love?
Was she in love? Had there been a growth of
feeling since that night at Carteret Street after the
holiday at Littlehampton? He uncomfortably suspected
that their hearts had come nearer to each
other that night than at any time since.</p>

<p>He tried to look forward to the moment when
he should invite her to be his wife. But was that
moment approaching? At the back of his mind lay
an apprehension that it was not. She satisfied one
part of his nature. She was the very spirit of grace;
she was full of aplomb and a delicate tact; she had
money. Moreover, her constant reliance upon him,
her clinging womanishness, the caressing, humouring
tone which her voice could assume, powerfully
affected him. He divined darkly that he was clay
in her hands; that all the future, even the future of
his own heart, depended entirely upon her. If she
chose, she might be his goddess.... And yet
she had sharp limitations....</p>

<p>Again, was she in love?</p>

<p>When he woke up of a morning he wondered how
long his present happiness would continue, and
whither it was leading him. A scrap of conversation
which he had had with Adeline recurred to him frequently.
He had asked her, once when she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
complained of ennui, why she did not become acquainted
with some of her neighbours.</p>

<p>"I don't care for my neighbours," she replied
curtly.</p>

<p>"But you can't live without acquaintances all your
life."</p>

<p>"No, not all my life," she said with significant
emphasis.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>




<h4>CHAPTER XXIII</h4>


<p>They had been to the National Gallery; it
was Saturday afternoon. Adeline said that
she would go home; but Richard, not without
a little trouble, persuaded her to dine in town
first; he mentioned a French restaurant in Soho.</p>

<p>As they walked up Charing Cross Road, he
pointed out the Crabtree, and referred to the fact
that at one time he had frequented it regularly. She
stopped to look at its white-and-gold frontage. In
enamel letters on the windows were the words:
"Table d'hôte, 6 to 9, 1/6."</p>

<p>"Is it a good place?" she asked.</p>

<p>"The best in London&mdash;of that kind."</p>

<p>"Then let us dine there; I have often wanted to
try a vegetarian restaurant."</p>

<p>Richard protested that she would not like it.</p>

<p>"How do you know? If you have been so often,
why shouldn't I go once?" She smiled at him, and
turned to cross the street; he hung back.</p>

<p>"But I only went for economy."</p>

<p>"Then we will only go for economy to-day."</p>

<p>He dangled before her the attractions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
French restaurant in Soho, but to no purpose. He
was loth to visit the Crabtree. Most probably Miss
Roberts would be on duty within, and he felt an inscrutable
unwillingness to be seen by her with Adeline....
At last they entered. Looking
through the glass doors which lead to the large, low-ceiled
dining-room on the first floor, Richard saw
that it was nearly empty, and that the cash-desk,
where Miss Roberts was accustomed to sit, was for
the moment unoccupied. He led the way in rather
hurriedly, and selected places in a far corner. Although
it was scarcely beginning to be dusk, the
table electric lights were turned on, and their red
shades made glimmering islands of radiance about
the room.</p>

<p>Richard kept a furtive watch on the cash-desk;
presently he saw Miss Roberts take her seat behind
it, and shifted his glance to another quarter. He
was preoccupied, and answered at random Adeline's
amused queries as to the food. Between the soup
and the entrée they were kept waiting; and Adeline,
Richard being taciturn, moved her chair in order to
look round the room. Her roving eyes stopped at
the cash-desk, left it, and returned to it. Then a
scornful smile, albeit scarcely perceptible, appeared
on her face; but she said nothing. Richard saw her
glance curiously at the cash-desk several times, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
he knew, too, that Miss Roberts had discovered
them. In vain he assured himself that Miss Roberts
was not concerned in his affairs; he could not
dismiss a sensation of uneasiness and discomfort.
Once he fancied that the eyes of the two girls met,
and that both turned away suddenly.</p>

<p>When the dinner was over, and they were drinking
the coffee for which the Crabtree is famous,
Adeline said abruptly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know someone here."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Richard, with fictitious nonchalance.
"Who?"</p>

<p>"The girl at the pay-desk,&mdash;Roberts, her name
is."</p>

<p>"Where have you met her?" he inquired.</p>

<p>Adeline laughed inimically. He was startled, almost
shocked, by the harsh mien which transformed
her face.</p>

<p>"You remember one night, just before uncle died,"
she began, bending towards him, and talking very
quietly. "Someone called while you and I were in
the sitting-room, to inquire how he was. That was
Laura Roberts. She used to know uncle&mdash;she
lives in our street. He made love to her&mdash;she
didn't care for him, but he had money and she encouraged
him. I don't know how far it went&mdash;I
believe I stopped it. Oh! men are the strangest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
creatures. Fancy, she's not older than me, and
uncle was over fifty!"</p>

<p>"Older than you, surely!" Richard put in.</p>

<p>"Well, not much. She knew I couldn't bear her,
and she called that night simply to annoy me."</p>

<p>"What makes you think that?"</p>

<p>"Think! I know it.... But you must
have heard of the affair. Didn't they talk about it
at your office?"</p>

<p>"I believe it was mentioned once," he said hastily.</p>

<p>She leaned back in her chair, with the same hard
smile. Richard felt sure that Miss Roberts had
guessed they were talking about herself, and that her
eyes were fixed on them, but he dared not look up
for confirmation; Adeline gazed boldly around her.
They were antagonistic, these two women, and
Richard, do what he would, could not repress a certain
sympathy with Miss Roberts. If she had encouraged
Mr. Aked's advances, what of that? It
was no mortal sin, and he could not appreciate the
reason of Adeline's strenuous contempt for her. He
saw a little gulf widening between himself and Adeline.</p>

<p>"What tremendously red hair that girl has!" she
said, later on.</p>

<p>"Yes, but doesn't it look fine!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ye-es," Adeline agreed condescendingly.</p>

<p>When he paid the bill, on the way out, Miss
Roberts greeted him with an inclination of the head.
He met her eye steadily, and tried not to blush.
As she checked the bill with a tapping pencil, he
could not help remarking her face. Amiability,
candour, honesty, were clearly written on its attractive
plainness. He did not believe that she had
been guilty of running after Mr. Aked for the sake
of his money. The tales told by Jenkins were
doubtless ingeniously exaggerated; and as for Adeline,
Adeline was mistaken.</p>

<p>"Good evening," Miss Roberts said simply, as
they went out. He raised his hat.</p>

<p>"You know her, then!" Adeline exclaimed in the
street.</p>

<p>"Well," he answered, "I've been going there,
off and on, for a year or two, and one gets acquainted
with the girls." His tone was rather petulant.
With a quick, winning smile, she changed the subject,
and he suspected her of being artful.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>




<h4>CHAPTER XXIV</h4>


<p>"I am going to America," she said.</p>

<p>They sat in the sitting-room at Carteret
street. Richard had not seen her
since the dinner at the vegetarian restaurant, and these
were almost the first words she addressed to him.
Her voice was as tranquil as usual; but he discerned,
or thought he discerned, in her manner a consciousness
that she was guilty towards him, that at least
she was not treating him justly.</p>

<p>The blow was like that of a bullet: he did not immediately
feel it.</p>

<p>"Really?" he questioned foolishly, and then,
though he knew that she would never return:
"For how long are you going, and how soon?"</p>

<p>"Very soon, because I always do things in a
hurry. I don't know for how long. It's indefinite.
I have had a letter from my uncles in San Francisco,
and they say I <i>must</i> join them; they can't do without
me. They are making a lot of money now, and
neither of them is married.... So I suppose
I must obey like a good girl. You see I have no
relatives here, except Aunt Grace."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>"You many never come back to England?"</p>

<p>(Did she colour, or was it Richard's fancy?)</p>

<p>"Well, I expect I may visit Europe sometimes.
It wouldn't do to give England up entirely. There
are so many nice things in England,&mdash;in London
especially...."</p>

<p>Once, in late boyhood, he had sat for an examination
which he felt confident of passing. When
the announcement arrived that he failed, he could
not believe it, though all the time he knew it to be
true. His thoughts ran monotonously: "There
must be some mistake; there must be some mistake!"
and like a little child in the night, he resolutely
shut his eyes to keep out the darkness of the
future. The same puerility marked him now. Assuming
that Adeline fulfilled her intention, his existence
in London promised to be tragically cheerless.
But this gave him no immediate concern, because he
refused to contemplate the possibility of their intimacy
being severed. He had, indeed, ceased to
think; somewhere at the back of the brain his
thoughts lay in wait for him. For the next two
hours (until he left the house) he lived mechanically,
as it were, and not by volition, subsisting merely
on a previously acquired momentum.</p>

<p>He sat in front of her and listened. She began
to talk of her uncles Mark and Luke. She described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
them in detail, told stories of her childhood,
even recounted the common incidents of her daily
life with them. She dwelt on their kindness of
heart, and their affection for herself; and with it all
she seemed a little to patronise them, as though she
had been accustomed to regard them as her slaves.</p>

<p>"They are rather old-fashioned," she said, "unless
they have altered. Since I heard from them, I
have been wondering what they would think about
my going to theatres and so on&mdash;with you."</p>

<p>"What should they think?" Richard broke in.
"There's nothing whatever in that. London isn't
a provincial town, or even an American city."</p>

<p>"I shall tell them all about you," she went on,
"and how kind you were to me when I scarcely knew
you at all. You couldn't have been kinder if you'd
been my only cousin."</p>

<p>"Say 'brother,'" he laughed awkwardly.</p>

<p>"No, really, I'm quite serious. I never thanked
you properly. Perhaps I seemed to take it all as a
matter of course."</p>

<p>He wished to heaven she would stop.</p>

<p>"I'm disgusted that you are going," he grumbled,
putting his hands behind his head,&mdash;"disgusted."</p>

<p>"In many ways I am sorry too. But don't you
think I am doing the right thing?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>"How am I to tell?" he returned quickly. "All
I know is that when you go I shall be left all alone by
my little self. You must think of me sometimes in
my lonely garret." His tone was light and whimsical,
but she would not follow his lead.</p>

<p>"I shall often think of you," she said musingly,
scanning intently the toe of her shoe.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that she desired to say something
serious, to justify herself to him, but could not
gather courage to frame the words.</p>

<p>When he got out of the house, his thoughts sprang
forth. It was a chilly night; he turned up the collar
of his overcoat, plunged his hands deep into the
pockets, and began to walk hurriedly, heedlessly,
while examining his feelings with curious deliberation.
In the first place, he was inexpressibly annoyed.
"Annoyed,"&mdash;that was the right word.
He could not say that he loved her deeply, or that
there was a prospect of his loving her deeply, but
she had become a delightful factor in his life, and
he had grown used to counting upon her for society.
Might he not, in time, conceivably have asked her to
marry him? Might she not conceivably have consented?
In certain directions she had disappointed
him; beyond doubt her spiritual narrowness had
checked the growth of a passion which he had sedulously
cherished and fostered in himself. Yet, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
spite of that, her feminine grace, her feminine
trustfulness, still exercised a strong and delicate
charm. She was a woman and he was a man, and
each was the only friend the other had; and now she
was going away. The mere fact that she found a
future with her uncles in America more attractive
than the life she was then leading, cruelly wounded
his self-love. He, then, was nothing to her, after
all; he had made no impression; she could relinquish
him without regret! At that moment she seemed
above and beyond him. He was the poor earthling;
she the winged creature that soared in freedom now
here, now there, giving her favours lightly, and as
lightly withdrawing them.</p>

<p>One thing came out clear: he was an unlucky fellow.</p>

<p>He ran over in his mind the people who would
remain to him in London when she had gone.
Jenkins, Miss Roberts&mdash;Bah! how sickeningly
commonplace were they! <i>She</i> was distinguished.
She had an air, a <i>je ne sais quoi</i>, which he had never
observed in a woman before. He recalled her
gowns, her gestures, her turns of speech,&mdash;all the
instinctive touches by which she proved her superiority.</p>

<p>It occurred to him fancifully that there was a
connection between her apparently sudden resolve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
to leave England, and their visit to the Crabtree
and encounter with Miss Roberts. He tried to see
in that incident a premonition of misfortune. What
morbid fatuity!</p>

<p>Before he went to sleep that night he resolved
that at their next meeting he would lead the conversation
to a frank discussion of their relations and
"have it out with her." But when he called at Carteret
Street two days later, he found it quite impossible
to do any such thing. She was light-hearted
and gay, and evidently looked forward to the
change of life with pleasure. She named the day of
departure, and mentioned that she had arranged to
take Lottie with her. She consulted him about a
compromise, already effected, with her landlord as
to the remainder of the tenancy, and said she had
sold the furniture as it stood, for a very small sum,
to a dealer. It hurt him to think that she had given
him no opportunity of actively assisting her in the
hundred little matters of business involved in a
change of hemisphere. What had become of her
feminine reliance upon him?</p>

<p>He felt as if some object was rapidly approaching
to collide with and crush him, and he was powerless
to hinder it.</p>

<p>Three days, two days, one day more!</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XXV</h4>


<p>The special train for Southampton, drawn up
against the main-line platform at Waterloo,
seemed to have resigned itself with an almost
animal passivity to the onslaught of the crowd
of well-dressed men and women who were boarding
it. From the engine a thin column of steam rose
lazily to the angular roof, where a few sparrows
fluttered with sudden swoops and short flights. The
engine-driver leaned against the side of the cab,
stroking his beard; the stoker was trimming coal on
the tender. Those two knew the spectacle by heart:
the scattered piles of steamer trunks amidst which
passengers hurried hither and thither with no apparent
object; the continual purposeless opening and
shutting of carriage doors; the deferential gestures
of the glittering guard as he bent an ear to ladies
whose footmen stood respectfully behind them; the
swift movements of the bookstall clerk selling papers,
and the meditative look of the bookstall manager
as he swept his hand along the shelf of new
novels and selected a volume which he could thoroughly
recommend to the customer in the fur coat;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
the long colloquies between husbands and wives, sons
and mothers, daughters and fathers, fathers and
sons, lovers and lovers, punctuated sometimes by the
fluttering of a handkerchief, or the placing of a hand
on a shoulder; the unconcealed agitation of most
and the carefully studied calm of a few; the grimaces
of porters when passengers had turned away; the
slow absorption by <i>their</i> train of all the luggage and
nearly all the people; the creeping of the clock towards
the hour; the kisses; the tears; the lowering of
the signal,&mdash;to them it was no more than a common
street-scene.</p>

<p>Richard, having obtained leave from the office,
arrived at a quarter to twelve. He peered up and
down. Could it be that she was really going? Not
even yet had he grown accustomed to the idea, and
at times he still said to himself, "It isn't really true;
there must be some mistake." The moment of separation,
now that it was at hand, he accused of having
approached sneakingly to take him unawares.
He was conscious of no great emotion, such as his
æsthetic sense of fitness might have led him to expect,&mdash;nothing
but a dull joylessness, the drab, negative
sensations of a convict foretasting a sentence of
years.</p>

<p>There she stood, by the bookstall, engaged in
lively talk with the clerk, while other customers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
waited. Lottie was beside her, holding a bag. The
previous night they had slept at Morley's Hotel.</p>

<p>"Everything is all right, I hope?" he said, eyeing
her narrowly, and feeling extremely sentimental.</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you.... Lottie, you must go
and keep watch over our seats.... Well,"
she went on briskly, when they were left alone, "I
am actually going. I feel somehow as if it can't be
true."</p>

<p>"Why, that is exactly how I have felt for days!"
he answered, allowing his voice to languish, and
then fell into silence. He assiduously coaxed himself
into a mood of resigned melancholy. With
sidelong glances, as they walked quietly down the
platform, he scanned her face, decided it was divine,
and dwelt lovingly on the thought: "I shall never
see it again."</p>

<p>"A dull day for you to start!" he murmured, in
tones of gentle concern.</p>

<p>"Yes, and do you know, a gentleman in the hotel
told me we should be certain to have bad weather,
and that made me so dreadfully afraid that I nearly
resolved to stay in England." She laughed.</p>

<p>"Ah, if you would!" he had half a mind to exclaim,
but just then he became aware of his affectation
and trampled on it. The conversation proceeded
naturally to the subject of seasickness and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
little joys and perils of the voyage. Strange topics
for a man and a woman about to be separated, probably
for ever! And yet Richard, for his part, could
think of none more urgent.</p>

<p>"I had better get in now, had I not?" she said.
The clock stood at five minutes to noon. Her face
was sweetly serious as she raised it to his, holding
out her hand.</p>

<p>"Take care of yourself," was his fatuous parting
admonition.</p>

<p>Her hand rested in his own, and he felt it tighten.
Beneath the veil the colour deepened a little in her
rosy cheeks.</p>

<p>"I didn't tell you," she said abruptly, "that my
uncles had begged me to go to them weeks and weeks
ago. I didn't tell you&mdash;and I put them off&mdash;because
I thought I would wait and see if you and I&mdash;cared
for each other."</p>

<p>It had come, the explanation! He blushed red,
and stuck to her hand. The atmosphere was suddenly
electric. The station and the crowd were
blotted out.</p>

<p>"You understand?" she questioned, smiling
bravely.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He was dimly conscious of having shaken hands
with Lottie, of the banging of many doors, of Adeline's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
face framed in a receding window. Then the
rails were visible beside the platform, and he had
glimpses of people hurriedly getting out of the train
at the platform opposite. In the distance the signal
clattered to the horizontal. He turned round, and
saw only porters, and a few forlorn friends of the
voyagers; one woman was crying.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Instead of going home from the office, he rambled
about the thoroughfares which converge at Piccadilly
Circus, basking in the night-glare of the City
of Pleasure. He had four pounds in his pocket.
The streets were thronged with swiftly rolling vehicles.
Restaurants and theatres and music halls, in
evening array, offered their gorgeous enticements,
and at last he entered the Café Royal, and, ordering
an elaborate dinner, ate it slowly, with thoughtful
enjoyment. When he had finished, he asked the
waiter to bring a "Figaro." But there appeared to
be nothing of interest in that day's "Figaro," and he
laid it down.... The ship had sailed by this
time. Had Adeline really made that confession to
him just before the train started, or was it a fancy
of his? There was something fine about her disconcerting
frankness ... fine, fine....
And the simplicity of it! He had let slip a treasure.
Because she lacked artistic sympathies, he had despised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
her, or at best underestimated her. And
once&mdash;to think of it!&mdash;he had nearly loved her....
With what astonishing rapidity their intimacy
had waxed, drooped, and come to sudden
death!... Love, what <i>was</i> love? Perhaps
he loved her now, after all....</p>

<p>"Waiter!" He beckoned with a quaint movement
of his forefinger which brought a smile to the
man's face&mdash;a smile which Richard answered jovially.</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"A shilling cigar, please, and a coffee and cognac."</p>

<p>At about nine o'clock he went out again into the
chill air, and the cigar burnt brightly between his
lips. He had unceremoniously dismissed the too
importunate image of Adeline, and he was conscious
of a certain devil-may-care elation.</p>

<p>Women were everywhere on the pavements.
They lifted their silk skirts out of the mud, revealing
ankles and lace petticoats. They smiled on him.
They lured him in foreign tongues and in broken
English. He broadly winked at some of the more
youthful ones, and they followed him importunately,
only to be shaken off with a laugh. As he walked,
he whistled or sang all the time. He was cut adrift,
he explained to himself, and through no fault of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
own. His sole friend had left him (much she
cared!), and there was none to whom he owed the
slightest consideration. He was at liberty to do
what he liked, without having to consider first,
"What would <i>she</i> think of this?" Moreover, he
must discover solace, poor blighted creature! Looking
down a side street, he saw a man talking to a
woman. He went past them, and heard what they
said. Then he was in Shaftesbury Avenue. Curious
sensations fluttered through his frame. With
an insignificant oath, he nerved himself to a resolve.</p>

<p>Several times he was on the very point of carrying
it out when his courage failed. He traversed
the Circus, got as far as St. James's Hall, and returned
upon his steps. In a minute he was on the
north side of Coventry Street. He looked into the
faces of all the women, but in each he found something
to repel, to fear.</p>

<p>Would it end in his going quietly home? He
crossed over into the seclusion of Whitcomb Street
to argue the matter. As he was passing the entry
to a court, a woman came out, and both had to draw
back to avoid a collision.</p>

<p>"<i>Chéri</i>!" she murmured. She was no longer
young, but her broad, Flemish face showed kindliness
and good humour in every feature of it, and her
voice was soft. He did not answer, and she spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
to him again. His spine assumed the consistency of
butter; a shuddering thrill ran through him. She
put her arm gently into his, and pressed it. He had
no resistance....</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>




<h4>CHAPTER XXVI</h4>


<p>It was the morning of Boxing Day, frosty, with
a sky of steel grey; the streets were resonant
under the traffic.</p>

<p>Richard had long been anticipating the advent of
the New Year, when new resolutions were to come
into force. A phrase from a sermon heard at Bursley
stuck in his memory: <i>Every day begins a new
year</i>. But he could not summon the swift, courageous
decision necessary to act upon that adage. For
a whole year he had been slowly subsiding into a bog
of lethargy, and to extricate himself would, he felt,
need an amount of exertion which he could not put
forth unless fortified by all the associations of the
season for such feats, and by the knowledge that fellow-creatures
were bracing themselves for a similar
difficult wrench.</p>

<p>Now that he looked back upon them, the fourteen
months which had elapsed since Adeline's departure
seemed to have succeeded one another with marvellous
rapidity. At first he had chafed under the loss
of her, and then gradually and naturally he had
grown used to her absence. She wrote to him, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
rather long letter, full of details about the voyage
and the train journey and her uncles' home; he had
opened the envelope half expecting that the letter
might affect him deeply; but it did not; it struck him
as a distinctly mediocre communication. He sent a
reply, and the correspondence ended. He did not
love her, probably never had loved her. A little
sentiment: that was all. The affair was quite over.
If it had been perhaps unsatisfactory, the fault was
not his. A man, he reflected, cannot by taking
thought fall in love (and yet this was exactly what he
had attempted to do!), and that in any case Adeline
would not have suited him. Still, at moments when
he recalled her face and gestures, her exquisite feminality,
and especially her fine candour at their parting,
he grew melancholy and luxuriously pitied himself.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the year which was now
drawing to a close he had attacked the art of literature
anew, and had compassed several articles; but
as one by one they suffered rejection, his energy had
dwindled, and in a short time he had again entirely
ceased to write. Nor did he pursue any ordered
course of study. He began upon a number of English
classics, finishing few of them, and continued to
consume French novels with eagerness. Sometimes
the French work, by its neat, severe effectiveness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
would stir in him a vague desire to do likewise, but no
serious sustained effort was made.</p>

<p>In the spring, when loneliness is peculiarly wearisome,
he had joined a literary and scientific institution,
for young men only, upon whose premises it was
forbidden either to drink intoxicants or to smoke
tobacco. He paid a year's subscription, and in less
than a fortnight loathed not only the institution but
every separate member and official of it. Then he
thought of transplanting himself to the suburbs, but
the trouble of moving the library of books which by
this time he had accumulated deterred him, as well
as a lazy aversion for the discomforts which a change
would certainly involve.</p>

<p>And so he had sunk into a sort of coma. His
chief task was to kill time. Eight hours were due
to the office and eight to sleep, and eight others remained
to be disposed of daily. In the morning he
rose late, retarding his breakfast hour, diligently
read the newspaper, and took the Park on the way to
business. In the evening, as six o'clock approached,
he no longer hurried his work in order to be ready
to leave the office immediately the clock struck. On
the contrary, he often stayed after hours when there
was no necessity to stay, either leisurely examining
his accounts, or gossiping with Jenkins or one of the
older clerks. He watched the firm's welfare with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
a jealous eye, offered suggestions to Mr. Curpet
which not seldom were accepted, and grew to be regarded
as exceptionally capable and trustworthy.
He could divine now and then in the tone or the look
of the principals (who were niggardly with praise)
an implicit trust, mingled&mdash;at any rate, in the case
of the senior partner&mdash;with a certain respect. He
grew more sedate in manner, and to the office boys,
over whom he had charge, he was even forbidding;
they disliked him, finding him a martinet more strict
and less suave than Mr. Curpet himself. He kept
them late at night sometimes without quite sufficient
cause, and if they showed dissatisfaction, told them
sententiously that boys who were so desperately anxious
to do as little as they could would never get on
in the world.</p>

<p>Upon leaving the office he would stroll slowly
through Booksellers' Row and up the Strand, with
the gait of a man whose time is entirely his own.
Once or twice a week he dined at one of the foreign
restaurants in Soho, prolonging the meal to an unconscionable
length, and repairing afterwards to
some lounge for a cigar and a liqueur. He paid
particular attention to his dress, enjoying the sensation
of wearing good clothes, and fell into a habit of
comparing his personal appearance with that of the
men whom he rubbed shoulders with in fashionable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
cafés and bars. His salary sufficed for these petty
extravagances, since he was still living inexpensively
in one room at Raphael Street; but besides what he
earned, his resources included the sum received from
the estate of William Vernon. Seventy pounds of
this had melted in festivities with Adeline, two hundred
pounds was lent upon mortgage under Mr. Curpet's
guidance, and the other fifty was kept in hand,
being broken into as infrequent occasion demanded.
The mortgage investment did much to heighten his
status not only with the staff but with his principals.</p>

<p>Seated in a wine-room or lager-beer hall, meditatively
sipping from glass or tankard, and savouring
a fragrant cigar, he contrived to extract a certain
pleasure from the contemplation of his equality with
the men around him. Many of them, he guessed
with satisfaction, were in a worse or a less secure position
than his own. He studied faces and made a
practice of entering into conversation with strangers,
and these chance encounters almost invariably left
him with the impression that he had met a mental
inferior. Steeping himself, as it were, in all the
frivolous, lusory activities of the West End, he began
to acquire that indefinable, unmistakable air of
<i>savoir-faire</i> characteristic of the prosperous clerk
who spends his leisure in public places. People
from the country frequently mistook him for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
young man-about-town of the society papers, familiar
with every form of metropolitan chicane, luxury, and
vice.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After breakfast he went out into the Park with
his skates. The Serpentine had been frozen hard
for more than a week, and yesterday, a solitary unit
in tens of thousands, he had celebrated Christmas
on the ice, skating from noon till nearly midnight,
with brief intervals for meals. The exercise and the
fresh air had invigorated and enlivened him, and this
morning, as he plunged once more into the loose
throng of skaters, his spirits were buoyant. It had
been his intention to pass yet another day on the Serpentine;
but a sudden, surprising fancy entered his
head, flitted away, and returned again and again
with such an increasing allurement that he fell in
love with it: Why not commence to write now?
Why, after all, leave the new beginning till the New
Year? Was it true&mdash;what he had mournfully
taken for granted for a month past, and so lately as
an hour ago&mdash;that he lacked the moral strength to
carry a good resolution into effect at any time he
chose?... In a moment, he had sworn to
work four hours before he slept that night.</p>

<p>The decision reached, his humour became unequivocally
gay. He shot forward with longer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
bolder strokes, enjoying with a keener zest the swift
motion and the strange black-and-white, sylvan-urban
scene about him. He forgot the year of idleness
which lay immediately behind him, forgot
every previous failure, in the passionate exultation
of his new resolve. He whistled. He sang. He
attempted impossible figures, and only laughed when
they ended in a fall. A woman, skating alone,
stumbled to her knees; he glided towards her, lifted
her lightly, raised his hat, and was gone before she
could thank him: it was neatly done; he felt proud
of himself. As the clock struck twelve he took off
his skates, and walked in a quiet corner of the Park,
deliberating intently upon the plot of a story, which
fortunately had been in his mind for several months.</p>

<p>When he came in to dinner, he gave Lily five
shillings for a Christmas box, almost without thinking,
and though he had no previous intention of doing
so; and inquired when she was to be married.
He ordered tea for four o'clock, so that the evening
might be long. In the afternoon he read and dozed.
At a quarter to five the tea-things were cleared
away, the lamp was burning brightly, the blinds
drawn, and his writing-materials arranged on the
table. He lit a pipe and sat down by the fire. At
last, at last, the old, long-abandoned endeavours were
about to be resumed!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>The story which he was going to write was called
"Tiddy-fol-lol." The leading character was an old
smith, to be named Downs, employed in the forge
of a large iron foundry at Bursley. Downs was a
Primitive Methodist of the narrowest type, and
when his daughter fell in love with and married a
sceneshifter at the local theatre, she received for
dowry a father's curse. Once, in the foundry,
Downs in speaking of the matter had referred to his
daughter as no better than a "Tiddy-fol-lol," and
for years afterwards a favourite sport of the apprentice
boys was to run after him, at a safe distance,
calling "Tiddy-fol-lol, Tiddy-fol-lol." The
daughter, completely estranged from her parent,
died in giving birth to a son who grew up physically
strong and healthy, but half an idiot. At the age of
twelve, quite ignorant of his grandfather's identity,
he was sent by his father to work at the foundry.
The other lads saw a chance for fun. Pointing out
Downs to him in the forge, they told him to go
close to the man and say "Tiddy-fol-lol." "What
dost thee want?" Downs questioned gruffly, when
the boy stood before him with a vacant grin on his
face. "Tiddy-fol-lol," came the response, in the
aggravating, uninflected tones peculiar to an imbecile.
Downs raised his tremendous arm in a flash
of anger, and felled the youngster with a blow on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
the side of the head. Then he bade him rise. But
the child, caught just under the ear, had been struck
dead. Downs was tried for manslaughter, pronounced
insane, and subsequently released as a harmless
lunatic. The Salvation Army took charge of
him, and he lived by selling "War-Cries" in the
streets, still pursued by boys who shouted "Tiddy-fol-lol."</p>

<p>Properly elaborated, Richard opined, such a plot
would make a powerful story. In his brain the
thing was already complete. The one difficulty lay
in the selection of a strong opening scene; that done,
he was sure the incidents of the tale would fall
naturally into place. He began to cogitate, but his
thoughts went wool-gathering most pertinaciously,
though time after time he compelled them to return
to the subject in hand by force of knitted brows.
He finished his pipe and recharged it. The fire
burnt low, and he put on more coal. Still no suitable
opening scene presented itself. His spirits
slowly fell. What ailed him?</p>

<p>At length, an idea! He was not going to fail,
after all. The story must of course begin with a
quarrel between old Downs and his daughter. He
drew up to the table, took a pen, and wrote the
title; then a few sentences, hurriedly, and then a
page. Then he read what was written, pronounced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
it unconvincing rubbish, and tore it up. Words
were untractable, and, besides, he could not <i>see</i> the
scene. He left the table, and after studying a tale
of de Maupassant's, started on a new sheet, carefully
imitating the manner of that writer. But he
could by no means satisfy himself. Mrs. Rowbotham
appeared with the supper-tray, and he laid
his writing-materials on the bed. During supper he
took up de Maupassant once more, and at ten
o'clock made yet a third attempt, well knowing beforehand
that it would not be successful. The plot
tumbled entirely to pieces; the conclusion especially
was undramatic; but how to alter it?...</p>

<p>He was disgusted with himself. He wondered
what would happen to him if he lost his situation.
Supposing that the firm of Curpet and Smythe
failed! Smythe was a careless fellow, capable of
ruining business in a month if for any reason Curpet's
restraining influence was withdrawn. These
and similar morbid fancies assailed him, and he went
to bed sick with misery, heartily wishing that he had
been less precipitate in his attempt to be industrious.
He had a superstition that if he had waited for
the New Year, the adventure might have resulted
more happily.</p>

<p>In the night he awoke, to lament upon his solitariness.
Why had he no congenial friends? How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
could he set about obtaining sympathetic companionship?
He needed, in particular, cultured feminine
society. Given that, he could work; without it
he should accomplish nothing. He reflected that in
London there were probably thousands of "nice
girls," pining for such men as he. What a ridiculous
civilisation it was that prevented him from meeting
them! When he saw a promising girl in a bus,
why in the name of heaven should he not be at liberty
to say to her, "Look here, I can convince you
that I mean well; let us make each other's acquaintance"?...
But convention, convention! He
felt himself to be imprisoned by a relentless, unscaleable
wall.... Then he dreamt that he
was in a drawing-room full of young men and
women, and that all were chattering vivaciously and
cleverly. He himself stood with his back to the
fire, and talked to a group of girls. They looked
into his face, as Adeline used to look. They
grasped his ideals and his aims without laborious explanations;
half a word was sufficient to enlighten
them; he saw the gleam of appreciative comprehension
in their eyes long before his sentences were finished....</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XXVII</h4>


<p>The next morning was bright with sunshine;
the frost had broken, and the streets were
beginning to be muddy. Richard went out,
his mind empty, and dully dejected. At Sloane
Street he mounted a bus, taking the one vacant front
seat on the top. For a little while he stared absently
at the handle of his stick. Presently a chance
movement of the head made him aware that someone's
eyes were upon him. He looked round. In
the far corner of the seat opposite was Miss Roberts.
She hesitated, flushing, and then bowed, and he responded.
No further communications were possible
just then (and for this, at the moment, he felt
thankful), because they were separated by two
young gentlemen wearing tweed caps, and collars
which might have been clean once, who were arguing
briskly over a copy of the "Sportsman."</p>

<p>For some strange reason of diffidence, Richard
had not been to the Crabtree since his visit there with
Adeline. He was sardonically in search of his motive
for staying away when the young gentlemen
with the "Sportsman" left the bus. Miss Roberts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
grew rosy as he got up and offered her his hand, at
the same time seating himself by her side. She
wore a black jacket and skirt, well worn but in good
preservation, a hat with red flowers, and grey woollen
gloves; and any person of ordinary discernment
would have guessed her occupation without a great
deal of difficulty. During the last year she had become
stouter, and her figure was now full rather
than slender; her features, especially the nostrils,
mouth, and chin, were somewhat heavy, but she had
prettily shaped ears, and her eyes, of no definable
tint, were soft and tender; her reddish-brown hair
was as conspicuous and as splendid as ever, coiled
with tight precision at the back of her head, and escaping
here and there above her ears in tiny flying
wisps. The expression of her face was mainly one
of amiability, but passive, animal-like, inert; she
seemed full of good-nature.</p>

<p>"We haven't seen you at the Crabtree, lately,"
she said.</p>

<p>"You are still at the old place, then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; and shall be, I expect. They've taken
another floor now, and we're the biggest vegetarian
restaurant in London."</p>

<p>There was a note of timid agitation in her voice,
and he noticed besides that her cheeks were red and
her eyes shone. Could it be that this encounter had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
given her pleasure? The idea of such a possibility
afforded him secret delight.... She, a
breathing woman, glad to see him! He wondered
what the other people on the bus were thinking of
them, and especially what the driver thought; the
driver had happened to catch sight of them when
they were shaking hands, and as Richard examined
the contour of the man's rubicund face, he fancied
he saw there a glimmer of a smile. This was during
a little pause in the conversation.</p>

<p>"And how have you spent Christmas?" It was
Richard's question.</p>

<p>"At home," she answered simply, "with father
and mother. My married sister and her husband
came over for the day."</p>

<p>"And I spent mine all alone," he said ruefully.
"No friends, no pudding, no nothing."</p>

<p>She looked at him compassionately.</p>

<p>"I suppose you live in rooms? It must be very
lonely."</p>

<p>"Oh!" he returned lightly, yet seizing with
eager satisfaction the sympathy she offered, "it's
nothing when you're used to it. This makes my
third Christmas in London, and none of them has
been particularly uproarious. Fortunately there
was the skating this year. I was on the Serpentine
nearly all day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she asked him if skating was easy to learn,
because she had been wanting to try for years, but
had never had opportunity. He answered that it
was quite easy, if one were not afraid.</p>

<p>"I'm going your way," he said, as they both
got off at Piccadilly Circus, and they walked along
Coventry Street together. The talk flagged; to
rouse it Richard questioned her about the routine of
the restaurant,&mdash;a subject on which she spoke readily,
and with a certain sense of humour. When
they reached the Crabtree,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, it's been painted!" Richard exclaimed.
"It looks very swagger, indeed, now."</p>

<p>"Yes, my! doesn't it? And it's beautiful inside,
too. You must come in sometime."</p>

<p>"I will," he said with emphasis.</p>

<p>She shook his hand quite vigorously, and their
eyes met with a curious questioning gaze. He
smiled to himself as he walked down Chandos Street;
his dejection had mysteriously vanished, and he even
experienced a certain uplifting of spirit. It occurred
to him that he had never at all understood
Miss Roberts before. How different she was outside
the restaurant! Should he go to the Crabtree
for lunch that day, or should he allow a day or two
to elapse? He decidedly prudently to wait.</p>

<p>He debated whether he should mention the meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
to Jenkins, and said on the whole that he would
not do so. But he found Jenkins surprisingly urbane,
and without conscious volition he was soon
saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Guess who I came down with on the bus this
morning."</p>

<p>Jenkins gave it up.</p>

<p>"Laura Roberts;" and then, seeing no look of
comprehension on Jenkins' face, "You know, the
cashier at the Crabtree."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;<i>her</i>!"</p>

<p>The stress was a little irritating.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> saw her about a fortnight ago," Jenkins said.</p>

<p>"At the Crabtree?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Did she say anything to you about me?"
The youth smiled.</p>

<p>"No. Why?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. We had a talk, and I mashed her a
bit,&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>"Ah, my boy, you won't get far with her."</p>

<p>"Oh, sha'n't I? I could tell you a thing or two
<i>re</i> Laura Roberts, if I liked."</p>

<p>Although Jenkins' remark was characteristic, and
Richard knew well enough that there was nothing
behind his words, yet his mind reverted instantly to
the stories connecting Miss Roberts with Mr.
Aked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't gas," he said curtly. "She looks on you
as a boy."</p>

<p>"Man enough for any woman," said Jenkins,
twirling the rudiments of a moustache.</p>

<p>The discussion might have gone further, had it
not been interrupted by Mr. Smythe, who burst suddenly
into the room, as his custom was.</p>

<p>"Larch, come with me into Mr. Curpet's room."
His tone was brusque. He had none of Mr. Curpet's
natural politeness, though on rare occasions, of
which the present was not one, he sought clumsily
to imitate it. Richard felt a vague alarm.</p>

<p>With a muffler round his throat, Mr. Curpet was
seated before the fire, blowing his nose and breathing
noisily. Mr. Smythe went to the window, and
played with the tassel of the blind cord.</p>

<p>"We are thinking of making some changes,
Larch," Mr. Curpet began.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." His heart sank. Was he to be dismissed?
The next sentence was reassuring.</p>

<p>"In future all costs will be drawn and settled in
the office, instead of being sent out. Do you feel
equal to taking charge of that department?"</p>

<p>Richard had many times helped in the preparation
of bills of cost, and possessed a fair knowledge of
this complicated and engaging subject. He answered
very decidedly in the affirmative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>"What we propose," Mr. Smythe broke in, "is
that you should have an assistant, and that the two
of you should attend to both the books and the
costs."</p>

<p>"Of course your salary will be increased," Mr.
Curpet added.</p>

<p>"Let me see, what do you get now?" This
from Mr. Smythe, whose memory was imperfect.</p>

<p>"Three pounds ten, sir."</p>

<p>"Suppose we say four pounds ten," said Mr.
Smythe to Mr. Curpet, and then turning to Larch:
"That's very good indeed, you know, young man;
you wouldn't get that everywhere. By Jove, no,
you wouldn't!" Richard was fully aware of the
fact. He could scarcely credit his own luck. "And
we shall expect you to keep things up to the mark."</p>

<p>Mr. Curpet smiled kindly over his handkerchief,
as if to intimate that Mr. Smythe need not have insisted
on that point.</p>

<p>"And you may have to stay late sometimes,"
Mr. Smythe went on.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>When the interview was finished, he retraced his
career at the office, marvelling that he should have
done anything unusual enough to inspire his principals
to such appreciation, and he soon made out
that, compared with others of the staff, he had indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
been a model clerk. A delicious self-complacence
enveloped him. Mr. Smythe had had the
air of conferring a favour; but Mr. Curpet was at
the head of affairs at No. 2 Serjeant's Court, and
Mr. Curpet's attitude had been decidedly flattering.
At first he had a difficulty in grasping his good fortune,
thought it too good to be true; but he ended
by believing in himself very heartily. In the matter
of salary, he stood now second only to Mr. Alder,
he a youth not three years out of the provinces.
Three years ago an income of £234 per annum
would have seemed almost fabulous. His notions
as to what constituted opulence had changed since
then, but nevertheless £234 was an excellent revenue,
full of possibilities. A man could marry on that
and live comfortably; many men ventured to marry
on half as much. In clerkdom he had indubitably
risen with ease to the upper ranks. There was good
Northern stuff in Richard Larch, after all! As he
walked home, his brain was busy with plans, beautiful
plans for the New Year,&mdash;how he would save
money, and how he would spend his nights in toil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>




<h4>CHAPTER XXVIII</h4>


<p>There happened to be a room to let on the
same floor as Richard's own. The rent was
only five shillings per week, and he arranged
to take it and use it as a bedroom, transforming
the other and larger room into a study. Mrs. Rowbotham
was asked to remove all her tables, chairs,
carpets, pictures, ornaments, and accessories from
both rooms, as he proposed to furnish them entirely
anew at his own cost. This did not indicate
that a sudden increase of revenue had, as once on a
previous occasion, engendered in him a propensity
to squander. On the contrary, his determination to
live economically was well established, and he hoped
to save a hundred pounds per annum with ease.
But the influence of an æsthetic environment upon
his literary work would, he argued, probably be valuable
enough to justify the moderate expenditure
involved, and so all the leisure of the last days of the
year was given to the realisation of certain theories
in regard to the furnishing of a study and a bedroom.
Unfortunately the time at his disposal was
very limited&mdash;- was it not essential that the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
should be set in order by the 31st of December, that
work might commence on the 1st of January?&mdash;but
he did not spare himself, and the result, when he
contemplated it on New Year's Eve, filled him with
pleasure and pride. He felt that he could write
worthily in that study, with its four autotype reproductions
of celebrated pictures on the self-coloured
walls, its square of Indian carpet over Indian matting,
its long, low bookshelves, its quaint table with
the elm top, its plain rush-bottomed chairs, and its
broad luxurious divan. He marvelled that he had
contrived so long to exist in the room as it was before,
and complacently attributed his ill-success as a
writer to the lack of harmonious surroundings. By
the last post arrived a New Year's card from Mrs.
Clayton Vernon. Twelve months ago she had sent
a similar kind token of remembrance, and he had
ignored it; in the summer she had written inviting
him to spend a few days at Bursley, and he had
somewhat too briefly asked to be excused. To-night,
however, he went out, bought a New Year's
card, and despatched it to her at once. He flowed
over with benevolence, viewing the world through
the rosy spectacles of high resolve. Mrs. Clayton
Vernon was an excellent woman, and he would prove
to her and to Bursley that they had not estimated
too highly the possibilities of Richard Larch. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
was, in truth, prodigiously uplifted. The old sense
of absolute power over himself for good or evil returned.
A consciousness of exceptional ability possessed
him. The future, splendid in dreams, was
wholly his; and yet again&mdash;perhaps more thoroughly
than ever before&mdash;the ineffectual past was
effaced. To-morrow was the New Year, and to-morrow
the new heaven and the new earth were to
begin.</p>

<p>He had decided to write a novel. Having failed
in short stories and in essays, it seemed to him likely
that the novel, a form which he had not so far seriously
attempted, might suit his idiosyncrasy better.
He had once sketched out the plot of a short novel,
a tale of adventure in modern London, and on examination
this struck him as ingenious and promising.
Moreover, it would appeal&mdash;like Stevenson's
"New Arabian Nights," which in Richard's
mind it distantly resembled&mdash;both to the general
and to the literary public. He determined to write
five hundred words of it a day, five days a week; at
this rate of progress he calculated that the book
would be finished in four months; allowing two
months further for revision, it ought to be ready for
a publisher at the end of June.</p>

<p>He drew his chair up to the blazing fire, and
looked down the vista of those long, lamplit evenings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
during which the novel was to grow under his
hands. How different he from the average clerk,
who with similar opportunities was content to fritter
away those hours which would lead himself, perhaps,
to fame! He thought of Adeline, and smiled.
What, after all, did such as he want with women?
He was in a position to marry, and if he met a clever
girl of sympathetic temperament, he emphatically
would marry (it did not occur to him to add the
clause, "Provided she will have me"); but otherwise
he would wait. He could afford to wait,&mdash;to
wait till he had made a reputation, and half a score
of women, elegant and refined, were only too willing
to envelop him in an atmosphere of adoration.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was part of his plan for economy to dine always
at the Crabtree, where one shilling was the
price of an elaborate repast, and he went there on
New Year's Day. As he walked up Charing Cross
Road, his thoughts turned naturally to Miss Roberts.
Would she be as cordial as when he had met
her on the omnibus, or would she wear the polite
mask of the cashier, treating him merely as a frequenter
of the establishment? She was engaged
when he entered the dining-room, but she noticed
him and nodded. He looked towards her several
times during his meal, and once her eyes caught his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
and she smiled, not withdrawing them for a few
moments; then she bent over her account book.</p>

<p>His fellow-diners seemed curiously to have degenerated,
to have grown still narrower in their sympathies,
still more careless in their eating, still more
peculiar or shabbier in their dress. The young
women of masculine aspect set their elbows on the
table more uncompromisingly than ever, and the
young men with soiled wristbands or no wristbands
at all were more than ever tedious in their murmured
conversations. It was, indeed, a bizarre company
that surrounded him! Then he reflected that these
people had not altered. The change was in himself.
He had outgrown them; he surveyed them now as
from a tower. He was a man with a future, using
this restaurant because it suited him temporarily to
do so, while they would use it till the end, never
deviating, never leaving the rut.</p>

<p>"So you have come at last!" Miss Roberts said
to him when he presented his check. "I was beginning
to think you had deserted us."</p>

<p>"But it's barely a week since I saw you," he protested.
"Let me wish you a happy New Year."</p>

<p>"The same to you." She flushed a little, and
then: "What do you think of our new decorations?
Aren't they pretty?"</p>

<p>He praised them perfunctorily, even without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
glancing round. His eyes were on her face. He
remembered the reiterated insinuations of Jenkins,
and wondered whether they had any ground of
fact.</p>

<p>"By the way, has Jenkins been here to-day?" he
inquired, by way of introducing the name.</p>

<p>"Is that the young man who used to come with
you sometimes? No."</p>

<p>There was no trace of self-consciousness in her
bearing, and Richard resolved to handle Jenkins
with severity. Another customer approached the
pay-desk.</p>

<p>"Well, good afternoon." He lingered.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon." Her gaze rested on him
softly. "I suppose you'll be here again <i>some</i>
time." She spoke low, so that the other customer
should not hear.</p>

<p>"I'm coming every day now, I think," he answered
in the same tone, with a smothered laugh.
"Ta-ta."</p>

<p>That night at half-past seven he began his novel.
The opening chapter was introductory, and the
words came without much effort. This being only
a draft, there was no need for polish; so that when
a sentence refused to run smoothly at the first trial,
he was content to make it grammatical and leave it.
He seemed to have been working for hours when a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
desire took him to count up what was already written.
Six hundred words! He sighed the sigh of
satisfaction, and looked at his watch, to find that it
was exactly half-past eight. The discovery somewhat
damped his felicity. He began to doubt
whether stuff composed at the rate of ten words a
minute could have any real value. Pooh! Sometimes
one wrote quickly, and sometimes slowly. The
number of minutes occupied was no index of quality.
Should he continue writing? Yes, he would....
No.... Why should he? He had performed
the task self-allotted for the day, and more;
and now he was entitled to rest. True, the actual
time of labour had been very short; but then, another
day the same amount of work might consume
three or four hours. He put away his writing-things,
and searched about for something to read,
finally lighting on "Paradise Lost." But "Paradise
Lost" wanted actuality. He laid it aside.
Was there any valid reason why he should not conclude
the evening at the theatre? None. The
frost had returned with power, and the reverberation
of the streets sounded invitingly through his
curtained windows. He went out, and walked
briskly up Park Side. At Hyde Park Corner he
jumped on an omnibus.</p>

<p>It was the first night of a new ballet at the Ottoman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
"Standing-room only," said the man at the
ticket-office. "All right," said Richard, and, entering,
was greeted with soft music, which came to him
like a fitful zephyr over a sea of heads.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>




<h4>CHAPTER XXIX</h4>


<p>One Saturday afternoon towards the end of
February, he suddenly decided to read
through so much of the draft novel as was
written; hitherto he had avoided any sort of revision.
The resolve to accomplish five hundred words a day
had been kept indifferently well, and the total stood
at about fourteen thousand. As he wrote a very
bold hand, the sheets covered made quite a respectable
pile. The mere bulk of them cajoled him, in
spite of certain misgivings, into an optimistic surmise
as to their literary quality. Never before had
he written so much upon one theme, and were the
writing good or bad, he was, for a few moments,
proud of his achievement. The mischief lay in the
fact that week by week he had exercised less and
still less care over the work. The phrase, "Anything
will do for a draft," had come to be uttered
with increasing frequency as an excuse for laxities
of style and construction. "I will make that right
in the revision," he had reassured himself, and had
gone negligently forward, leaving innumerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
crudities in the wake of his hurrying pen. During
the last few days he had written scarcely anything,
and perhaps it was a hope of stimulating a drooping
inspiration by the complacent survey of work actually
done that tempted him to this hazardous perusal.</p>

<p>He whistled as he took up the manuscript, as a
boy whistles when going into a dark cellar. The
first three pages were read punctiliously, every word
of them, but soon he grew hasty, rushing to the next
paragraph ere the previous one was grasped; then
he began shamelessly to skip; and then he stopped,
and his heart seemed to stop also. The lack of
homogeneity, of sequence, of dramatic quality, of
human interest; the loose syntax; and the unrelieved
mediocrity of it all, horrified him. The thing was
dry bones, a fiasco. The certainty that he had once
more failed swept over him like a cold, green wave
of the sea, and he had a physical feeling of sickness
in the stomach.... It was with much ado
that he refrained from putting the whole manuscript
upon the fire, and crushing it venomously into the
flames with a poker. Then he steadied himself.
His self-confidence was going, almost gone; he must
contrive to recover it, and he sought for a way.
(Where were now the rash exultations of the New
Year?) It was impossible that his work should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
irredeemably bad. He remembered having read
somewhere that the difference between a fine and a
worthless novel was often a difference of elaboration
simply. A conscientious re-writing, therefore, might
probably bring about a surprising amelioration. He
must immediately make the experiment. But he
had long since solemnly vowed not to commence the
second writing till the draft was done; the moral
value of finishing even the draft had then seemed to
him priceless. No matter! Under stress of
grievous necessity, that oath must be forsworn. No
other course could save him from collapse.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He went out into the streets. The weather, fine
and bright, suggested the earliest infancy of spring,
and Piccadilly was full of all classes and all ages of
women. There were regiments of men, too, but
the gay and endless stream of women obsessed him.
He saw them sitting in hansoms and private carriages
and on the tops of omnibuses, niched in high
windows, shining in obscurity of shops, treading the
pavements with fairy step, either unattended or by
the side of foolish, unappreciative males. Every
man in London seemed to have the right to a share
of some woman's companionship, except himself. As
for those men who walked alone, they had sweethearts
somewhere, or mothers and sisters, or they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
were married and even now on the way to wife and
hearth. Only he was set apart.</p>

<p>A light descended upon him that afternoon. The
average man and the average woman being constantly
thrown into each other's society, custom has
staled for them the exquisite privilege of such intercourse.
The rustic cannot share the townsman's enthusiasm
for rural scenery; he sees no matter for
ecstasy in the view from his cottage door; and in the
same way the average man and the average woman
dine together, talk together, walk together,
and know not how richly they are therein
blessed. But with solitaries like Richard it is
different. Debarred from fellowship with the
opposite sex by circumstances and an innate
diffidence which makes the control of circumstance
impossible, their starved sensibilities acquire
certain morbid tenderness. (Doubtless the rustic
discerns morbidity in the attitude of the townsman
towards the view from his cottage door.) Richard
grasped this. In a luminous moment of self-revelation,
he was able to trace the growth of the malady.
From its first vague and fugitive symptoms, it
had so grown that now, on seeing an attractive
woman, he could not be content to say, "What an
attractive woman!" and have done with it, but he
needs must build a house, furnish a room in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
house, light a fire in the room, place a low chair by
the fire, put the woman in the chair, with a welcoming
smile on her upturned lips&mdash;and imagine that she
was his wife. And it was not only attractive women
that laid the spell upon him. The sight of any living
creature in petticoats was liable to set his hysterical
fancy in motion. Every woman he met was
Woman.... Of the millions of women in
London, why was he not permitted to know a few?
Why was he entirely cut off? There they were:
their silk skirts brushed him as they passed; they
thanked him for little services in public vehicles;
they ministered to him in restaurants; they sang to
him at concerts, danced for him at theatres; touched
his existence at every side&mdash;and yet they were remoter
than the stars, unattainable as the moon....
He rebelled. He sank in despair, and
rose to frenzies of anger. Then he was a pathetic
figure, and extended to himself his own pity, smiling
sardonically at fate. Fate was the harder to bear
because he was convinced that, at the heart of him,
he was essentially a woman's man. None could enjoy
the feminine atmosphere more keenly, more artistically
than he. Other men, who had those delicious
rights for which he longed in vain, assessed
them meanly, or even scorned them.... He
looked back with profound regret to his friendship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
with Adeline. He dreamt that she had returned,
that he had fallen in love with her and married her,
that her ambitions were leading him forward to success.
Ah! Under the incentive of a woman's eyes,
of what tremendous efforts is a clever man not
capable, and deprived of it to what deeps of stagnations
will he not descend! Then he awoke again
to the fact that he knew no woman in London.</p>

<p>Yes, he knew one, and his thoughts began to play
round her caressingly, idealising and ennobling her.
She only gave him his change daily at the Crabtree,
but he knew her; there existed between them a kind
of intimacy. She was a plain girl, possessing few attractions,
except the supreme one of being a woman.
She was below him in station; but had she not her
refinements? Though she could not enter into his
mental or emotional life, did she not exhale for him
a certain gracious influence? His heart went forth
to her. Her flirtations with Mr. Aked, her alleged
dalliance with Jenkins? Trifles, nothings! She
had told him that she lived with her mother and
father and a younger brother, and on more than one
occasion she had mentioned the Wesleyan chapel;
he had gathered that the whole family was religious.
In theory he detested religious women, and yet&mdash;religion
in a woman ... what was it? He
answered the question with a man's easy laugh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
And if her temperament was somewhat lymphatic,
he divined that, once roused, she was capable of the
most passionate feeling. He had always had a predilection
for the sleeping-volcano species of woman.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XXX</h4>


<p>Richard was soon forced to the conclusion
that the second writing of his novel was
destined to be a failure. For a few days
he stuck doggedly to the task, writing stuff which, as
he wrote it, he knew would ultimately be condemned.
Then one evening he stopped suddenly, in the middle
of a word, bit the penholder for a moment, and threw
it down with a "Damn!" This sort of thing could
not continue.</p>

<p>"Better come up and see my new arrangements
at Raphael Street to-night," he said to Jenkins the
next day. He wanted a diversion.</p>

<p>"Any whisky going?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Delighted, I'm sure," said Jenkins, with one of
his ridiculous polite bows. He regarded these rare
invitations as an honour; it was more than six months
since the last.</p>

<p>They drank whisky and smoked cigars which Jenkins
had thoughtfully brought with him, and chattered
for a long time about office matters. And
then, as the cigar-ash accumulated, the topics became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
more personal and intimate. That night Jenkins
was certainly in a serious vein; further, he was on
his best behaviour, striving to be sympathetic and
gentlemanly. He confided to Richard his aspirations.
He wished to learn French and proposed to
join a Polytechnic Institute for the purpose. Also,
he had thoughts of leaving home, and living in
rooms, like Richard. He was now earning twenty-eight
shillings a week; he intended to save money
and to give up all intoxicants beyond half a pint of
bitter a day. Richard responded willingly to his
mood, and offered sound advice, which was listened
to with deference. Then the talk, as often aforetime,
drifted to the subject of women. It appeared
that Jenkins had a desire to "settle down" (he was
twenty-one). He knew several fellows in the Walworth
Road who had married on less than he was
earning.</p>

<p>"What about Miss Roberts?" Richard questioned.</p>

<p>"Oh! She's off. She's a bit too old for me,
you know. She must be twenty-six."</p>

<p>"Look here, my boy," said Richard, good-humouredly.
"I don't believe you ever had anything
to do with her at all. It was nothing but boasting."</p>

<p>"What will you bet I can't prove it to you?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
Jenkins retorted, putting out his chin, an ominous
gesture with him.</p>

<p>"I'll bet you half-a-crown&mdash;no, a shilling."</p>

<p>"Done."</p>

<p>Jenkins took a leather-case from his pocket, and
handed Richard a midget photograph of Miss Roberts.
Underneath it was her signature, "Yours sincerely,
Laura Roberts."</p>

<p>Strange to say, the incident did not trouble Richard
in the least.</p>

<p>He walked down to Victoria with Jenkins towards
midnight, and on returning to his lodging, thought
for the hundredth time how futile was his present
mode of existence, how bare of all that makes life
worth living. Of what avail to occupy pretty
rooms, if one occupied them alone, coming into them
at night to find them empty, leaving them in the
morning without a word of farewell? In the waste
of London, Laura Roberts made the one green spot.
He had lost interest in his novel. On the other
hand, his interest in the daily visit to the Crabtree
was increasing.</p>

<p>As day succeeded day he fell into a practice of
deliberately seeking out and magnifying the finer
qualities in her nature, while ignoring those which
were likely to offend him; indeed he refused to allow
himself to be offended. He went so far as to retard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
his lunch-hour permanently, so that, the rush of customers
being past, he should have better opportunity
to talk to her without interruption. Then he timidly
essayed the first accents of courtship, and finding
his advances accepted, grew bolder. One Sunday
morning he met her as she was coming out of the
Wesleyan chapel at Munster Park; he said the encounter
was due to accident. She introduced him to
her relations, who were with her. Her father was
a big, stout, dark man, dressed in black faced-cloth,
with a heavy beard, huge chubby fingers, and jagged
grey fingernails. Her mother was a spare woman
of sorrowful aspect, whose thin lips seldom moved;
she held her hands in front of her, one on the top of
the other. Her brother was a lank schoolboy, wearing
a damaged mortar-board hat.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards he called on her at Carteret
Street. The schoolboy opened the door, and after
inviting him as far as the lobby, vanished into a back
room only to reappear and run upstairs. Richard
heard his loud, agitated whisper: "Laura, Laura,
here's Mr. Larch come to see you."</p>

<p>They strolled to Wimbledon Common that night.</p>

<p>His entity seemed to have become dual. One
part of him was willingly enslaved to an imperious,
headstrong passion; the other stood calmly, cynically
apart, and watched. There were hours when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
could foresee the whole of his future life, and
measure the bitter, ineffectual regret which he was
laying up; hours when he admitted that his passion
had been, as it were, artificially incited, and that
there could be no hope of an enduring love. He
liked Laura; she was a woman, a balm, a consolation.
To all else he obstinately shut his eyes, and,
casting away every consideration of prudence, hastened
to involve himself more and more deeply.
Swiftly, swiftly, the climax approached. He hailed
it with a strange, affrighted joy.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XXXI</h4>


<p>They were upon Chelsea Embankment in the
late dusk of a Saturday evening in May. A
warm and gentle wind stirred the budding
trees to magic utterances. The long, straight line
of serried lamps stretched away to an enchanted
bridge which with twinkling lights hung poised over
the misty river. The plash of an oar came languorously
up from the water, and the voices of boys
calling. At intervals, couples like themselves passed
by, either silent or conversing in low tones that
seemed to carry inner, inarticulate meanings. As
for them, they were silent; he had not her arm, but
they walked close together. He was deeply and indescribably
moved; his heart beat heavily, and when
he looked at her face in the gloom and saw that her
eyes were liquid, it beat yet more heavily; then lay
still.</p>

<p>"Let us sit down&mdash;shall we?" he said at length,
and they turned to an empty bench under a tree.
"What is she thinking?" he wondered, and then
the dominant feeling of the moment possessed him
wholly. His ambitions floated out of sight and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
were forgotten. He remembered nothing except
the girl by his side, whose maddening bosom rose
and fell under his very gaze. At that moment she
belonged to no class; had no virtues, no faults. All
the inessentials of her being were stripped away,
and she was merely a woman, divine, desired, necessary,
waiting to be captured. She sat passive, expectant,
the incarnation of the Feminine.</p>

<p>He took her hand and felt it tremble. At the
contact a thrill ran about him, and for a second a
delicious faintness robbed him of all strength.
Then with inexplicable rapidity his mind went unerringly
back to that train-journey to William's
funeral. He saw the cottage in the fields, and the
young mother, half robed and with sleep in her eyes,
standing at the door. Exquisite vision!</p>

<p>He heard himself speaking,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Laura...."</p>

<p>The little hand gave a timorous encouragement.</p>

<p>"Laura ... you are going to marry me."</p>

<p>The intoxicating pressure of her lips on his
was answer. Heedless of publicity, he crushed her
against his breast, this palpitating creature with the
serious face. Ah, she could love!</p>

<p>It was done. The great irretrievable moment
had gone to join a million other moments of no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
significance. He felt triumphant, fiercely triumphant.
His frightful solitude was at an end. One
woman was his. A woman ... his, his own!</p>

<p>See! A tear quivered in her eye.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XXXII</h4>


<p>Sunday was stiflingly hot. At Sloane Street
the roof of every Putney omnibus was already
laden with passengers, and Richard on his way
to Carteret Street to make the acquaintance of Laura's
married sister, Milly Powell, her husband and young
child, was forced at last to be content with a seat
inside. The public houses were just closing for the
afternoon, and the footpaths full of holiday-makers,
with here and there a girl or a middle-aged man
carrying a Bible. No vehicles were abroad except
the omnibuses and an occasional hired carriage which
passed by with a nonchalant, lazy air.</p>

<p>At the Redcliffe Arms there got in a little family
party consisting of a stout, seemingly prosperous
man, gruffly good-humoured, his wife, and a boy of
about three years, whose puffy face was disfigured by
large spectacles.</p>

<p>"Sit here, Milly, out of the sun," the man said
curtly.</p>

<p>Richard looked up at the sound of the name.
The woman's likeness to Laura was unmistakable;
beyond doubt she must be the sister of his betrothed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
He examined her curiously. She was perhaps
slightly under thirty, of a good height and well set,
with a large head and a large, plain face. Her
movements were clumsy. She appeared to be just
upon the line which divides the matron from the
young mother. In both her features and her attire
there were faint reminders of girlish grace, or at
least of the charm of the shy wife who nurses her
first-born. Her complexion was clear and fresh, her
ears small and delicately pink, her eyes cool grey.
But one did not notice these beauties without careful
inspection, while the heavy jaws, the lax eyelids,
the flattened nose whose tilt unpleasantly revealed
the nostrils, were obvious and repellent. She wore
a black gown, which fitted badly, imparting an ungainliness
probably foreign to her proper figure.
Her broad hat of black straw, trimmed with poppies
and corn-flowers, was strikingly modish, and the veil,
running at an angle from the extremity of the brim
down to her chin, gave to her face a cloistered quality
which had its own seductiveness. Her small
hands were neatly gloved, and held a cheap, effective
parasol. The woman's normal expression was one
of cow-like vacancy, but now and then her eyes would
light up as she spoke to the child, gently restraining
it, reassuring it, rallying it with simple banter. She
was still in love with her husband; frequently she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
glanced at him with furtive wistfulness. She was
able to enjoy the summer weather. She was not
quite dead to the common phenomena of the roadside.
But the last resistances of departing youthfulness
and vivacity against the narcotic of a dull, unlovely
domesticity were taking place. In a year or
two she would be the typical matron of the lower
middle-class.</p>

<p>When Richard had made these observations, he
reflected: "Laura will be like that&mdash;soon."
Mentally he compared the two faces, and he could,
as it were, see Laura's changing....</p>

<p>Then followed a reverie which embraced the
whole of his past life. He recognised that, while he
bore all the aspect of prosperity, he had failed.
Why had nature deprived him of strength of purpose?
Why could not he, like other men, bend
circumstances to his own ends? He sought for a
reason, and he found it in his father, that mysterious,
dead transmitter of traits, of whom he knew so
little, and on whose name lay a blot of some kind
which was hidden from him. He had been born in
the shadow, and after a fitful struggle towards emergence,
into the shadow he must again retire. Fate
was his enemy. Mary had died; Mary would have
helped him to be strong. Mr. Aked had died; Mr.
Aked's inspiring influence would have incited and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
guided his efforts. Adeline had abandoned him to
a fatal loneliness.</p>

<p>He knew that he would make no further attempt
to write. Laura was not even aware that he had
had ambitions in that direction. He had never told
her, because she would not have understood. She
worshipped him, he felt sure, and at times he had a
great tenderness for her; but it would be impossible
to write in the suburban doll's-house which was to be
theirs. No! In future he would be simply the
suburban husband&mdash;dutiful towards his employers,
upon whose grace he would be doubly dependent;
keeping his house in repair; pottering in the garden;
taking his wife out for a walk, or occasionally to the
theatre; and saving as much as he could. He would
be good to his wife&mdash;she was his. He wanted to
get married at once. He wanted to be master of
his own dwelling. He wanted to have Laura's kiss
when he went out of a morning to earn the bread-and-cheese.
He wanted to see her figure at the
door when he returned at night. He wanted to
share with her the placid, domestic evening. He
wanted to tease her, and to get his ears boxed and
be called a great silly. He wanted to creep into
the kitchen and surprise her with a pinch of the
cheek as she bent over the range. He wanted to
whisk her up in his arms, carry her from one room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
to another, and set her down breathless in a chair....
Ah! Let it be soon. And as for the
more distant future, he would not look at that. He
would keep his eyes on the immediate foreground,
and be happy while he could. After all, perhaps
things had been ordered for the best; perhaps he
had no genuine talent for writing. And yet at that
moment he was conscious that he possessed the incommunicable
imaginative insights of the author....
But it was done with now.</p>

<p>The conductor called out their destination, and
as Laura's sister gathered the child in her arms he
sprang out and hurried down Carteret Street in
order to reach the house first and so avoid a meeting
on the doorstep. He heard the trot of the child
behind him. Children.... Perhaps a child
of his might give sign of literary ability. If so&mdash;and
surely these instincts descended, were not lost&mdash;how
he would foster and encourage it!</p>
